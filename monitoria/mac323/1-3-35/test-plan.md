# What Should I Test?
- Two independent runs wield different results
- No repetitions in a permutation
- Every 4-permutation should appear in less than 200 tests
- It takes little time to generate a random 10^6-permutation (and does not fault)
- I can enqueue while I dequeue
- Every method is implemented (boolean isEmpty(), void enqueue(Item), Item dequeue(), Item sample())
- Sampling works (try to sample from a 1-queue and it should not get empty)
