a
introduction
before
the
dawn
of
history
mankind
was
engaged
in
the
study
of
dreaming
the
wise
man
among
the
ancients
was
preminently
the
interpreter
of
dreams
the
ability
to
interpret
successfully
or
plausibly
was
the
quickest
road
to
royal
favor
as
joseph
and
daniel
found
it
to
be
failure
to
give
satisfaction
in
this
respect
led
to
banishment
from
court
or
death
when
a
scholar
laboriously
translates
a
cuneiform
tablet
dug
up
from
a
babylonian
mound
where
it
has
lain
buried
for
five
thousand
years
or
more
the
chances
are
that
it
will
turn
out
either
an
astrological
treatise
or
a
dream
book
if
the
former
we
look
upon
it
with
some
indulgence
if
the
latter
with
pure
contempt
for
we
know
that
the
study
of
the
stars
though
undertaken
for
selfish
reasons
and
pursued
in
the
spirit
of
charlatanry
led
at
length
to
physical
science
while
the
study
of
dreams
has
proved
as
unprofitable
as
the
dreaming
of
them
out
of
astrology
grew
astronomy
out
of
oneiromancy
has
grown--nothing
that
at
least
was
substantially
true
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
dream
books
in
all
languages
continued
to
sell
in
cheap
editions
and
the
interpreters
of
dreams
made
a
decent
or
at
any
rate
a
comfortable
living
out
of
the
poorer
classes
but
the
psychologist
rarely
paid
attention
to
dreams
except
incidentally
in
his
study
of
imagery
association
and
the
speed
of
thought
but
now
a
change
has
come
over
the
spirit
of
the
times
the
subject
of
the
significance
of
dreams
so
long
ignored
has
suddenly
become
a
matter
of
energetic
study
and
of
fiery
controversy
the
world
over
the
cause
of
this
revival
of
interest
is
the
new
point
of
view
brought
forward
by
professor
bergson
in
the
paper
which
is
here
made
accessible
to
the
english-reading
public
this
is
the
idea
that
we
can
explore
the
unconscious
substratum
of
our
mentality
the
storehouse
of
our
memories
by
means
of
dreams
for
these
memories
are
by
no
means
inert
but
have
as
it
were
a
life
and
purpose
of
their
own
and
strive
to
rise
into
consciousness
whenever
they
get
a
chance
even
into
the
semi-consciousness
of
a
dream
to
use
professor
bergsons
striking
metaphor
our
memories
are
packed
away
under
pressure
like
steam
in
a
boiler
and
the
dream
is
their
escape
valve
that
this
is
more
than
a
mere
metaphor
has
been
proved
by
professor
freud
and
others
of
the
vienna
school
who
cure
cases
of
hysteria
by
inducing
the
patient
to
give
expression
to
the
secret
anxieties
and
emotions
which
unknown
to
him
have
been
preying
upon
his
mind
the
clue
to
these
disturbing
thoughts
is
generally
obtained
in
dreams
or
similar
states
of
relaxed
consciousness
according
to
the
freudians
a
dream
always
means
something
but
never
what
it
appears
to
mean
it
is
symbolic
and
expresses
desires
or
fears
which
we
refuse
ordinarily
to
admit
to
consciousness
either
because
they
are
painful
or
because
they
are
repugnant
to
our
moral
nature
a
watchman
is
stationed
at
the
gate
of
consciousness
to
keep
them
back
but
sometimes
these
unwelcome
intruders
slip
past
him
in
disguise
in
the
hands
of
fanatical
freudians
this
theory
has
developed
the
wildest
extravagancies
and
the
voluminous
literature
of
psycho-analysis
contains
much
that
seems
to
the
layman
quite
as
absurd
as
the
stuff
which
fills
the
twenty-five
cent
dream
book
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
the
subconsciousness
of
every
one
of
us
contains
nothing
but
the
foul
and
monstrous
specimens
which
they
dredge
up
from
the
mental
depths
of
their
neuropathic
patients
and
exhibit
with
such
pride
bergsons
view
seems
to
me
truer
as
it
is
certainly
more
agreeable
that
we
keep
stored
away
somewhere
all
our
memories
the
good
as
well
as
the
evil
the
pleasant
together
with
the
unpleasant
there
may
be
nightmares
down
cellar
as
we
thought
as
a
child
but
even
in
those
days
we
knew
how
to
dodge
them
when
we
went
after
apples
that
is
take
down
a
light
and
slam
the
door
quickly
on
coming
up
maeterlinck
too
knew
this
trick
of
our
childhood
when
in
the
palace
of
night
scene
of
his
fairy
play
the
redoubtable
tyltyl
unlocks
the
cage
where
are
confined
the
nightmares
and
all
other
evil
imaginings
he
shuts
the
door
in
time
to
keep
them
in
and
then
opens
another
revealing
a
lovely
garden
full
of
blue
birds
which
though
they
fade
and
die
when
brought
into
the
light
of
common
day
yet
encourage
him
to
continue
his
search
for
the
blue
bird
that
never
fades
but
lives
everlastingly
the
new
science
of
dreams
is
giving
a
deeper
significance
to
the
trite
wish
of
good
night
and
pleasant
dreams
it
means
sweet
sanity
and
mental
health
pure
thoughts
and
good
will
to
all
men
professor
bergsons
theory
of
dreaming
here
set
forth
in
untechnical
language
fits
into
a
particular
niche
in
his
general
system
of
philosophy
as
well
as
does
his
little
book
on
laughter
with
the
main
features
of
his
philosophy
the
english-reading
public
is
better
acquainted
than
with
any
other
contemporary
system
for
his
books
have
sold
even
more
rapidly
here
than
in
france
when
professor
bergson
visited
the
united
states
two
years
ago
the
lecture-rooms
of
columbia
university
like
those
of
the
collge
de
france
were
packed
to
the
doors
and
the
effect
of
his
message
was
enhanced
by
his
eloquence
of
delivery
and
charm
of
personality
the
pragmatic
character
of
his
philosophy
appeals
to
the
genius
of
the
american
people
as
is
shown
by
the
influence
of
the
teaching
of
william
james
and
john
dewey
whose
point
of
view
in
this
respect
resembles
bergsons
during
the
present
generation
chemistry
and
biology
have
passed
from
the
descriptive
to
the
creative
stage
man
is
becoming
the
overlord
of
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
he
is
learning
to
make
gems
and
perfumes
drugs
and
foods
to
suit
his
tastes
instead
of
depending
upon
the
chance
bounty
of
nature
he
is
beginning
consciously
to
adapt
means
to
ends
and
to
plan
for
the
future
even
in
the
field
of
politics
he
has
opened
up
the
atom
and
finds
in
it
a
microcosm
more
complex
than
the
solar
system
he
beholds
the
elements
melting
with
fervent
heat
and
he
turns
their
rays
to
the
healing
of
his
sores
he
drives
the
lightning
through
the
air
and
with
the
product
feeds
his
crops
he
makes
the
desert
to
blossom
as
the
rose
and
out
of
the
sea
he
draws
forth
dry
land
he
treats
the
earth
as
his
habitation
remodeling
it
in
accordance
with
his
ever-varying
needs
and
increasing
ambitions
this
modern
man
planning
contriving
and
making
finds
paleys
watch
as
little
to
his
mind
as
lucretiuss
blind
flow
of
atoms
a
universe
wound
up
once
for
all
and
doing
nothing
thereafter
but
mark
time
is
as
incomprehensible
to
him
as
a
universe
that
never
had
a
mind
of
its
own
and
knows
no
difference
between
past
and
future
the
idea
of
eternal
recurrence
does
not
frighten
him
as
it
did
nietzsche
for
he
feels
it
to
be
impossible
the
mechanistic
interpretation
of
natural
phenomena
developed
during
the
last
century
he
accepts
at
its
full
value
and
would
extend
experimentally
as
far
as
it
will
go
for
he
finds
it
not
invalid
but
inadequate
to
minds
of
this
temperament
it
is
no
wonder
that
bergsons
creative
evolution
came
with
the
force
of
an
inspiration
men
felt
themselves
akin
to
this
upward
impulse
this
lan
vital
which
struggling
throughout
the
ages
with
the
intractableness
of
inert
matter
yet
finally
in
some
way
or
other
forces
it
to
its
will
and
ever
strives
toward
the
increase
of
vitality
mentality
personality
bergson
has
been
reluctant
to
commit
himself
on
the
question
of
immortality
but
he
of
late
has
become
quite
convinced
of
it
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
think
it
possible
that
we
may
find
experimental
evidence
of
personal
persistence
after
death
this
at
least
we
might
infer
from
his
recent
acceptance
of
the
presidency
of
the
british
society
for
psychical
research
in
his
opening
address
before
the
society
may
he
discussed
the
question
of
telepathy
and
in
that
connection
he
explained
his
theory
of
the
relation
of
mind
and
brain
in
the
following
language
i
quote
from
the
report
in
the
london
times
the
rle
of
the
brain
is
to
bring
back
the
remembrance
of
an
action
to
prolong
the
remembrance
in
movements
if
one
could
see
all
that
takes
place
in
the
interior
of
the
brain
one
would
find
that
that
which
takes
place
there
corresponds
to
a
small
part
only
of
the
life
of
the
mind
the
brain
simply
extracts
from
the
life
of
the
mind
that
which
is
capable
of
representation
in
movement
the
cerebral
life
is
to
the
mental
life
what
the
movements
of
the
baton
of
a
conductor
are
to
the
symphony
the
brain
then
is
that
which
allows
the
mind
to
adjust
itself
exactly
to
circumstances
it
is
the
organ
of
attention
to
life
should
it
become
deranged
however
slightly
the
mind
is
no
longer
fitted
to
the
circumstances
it
wanders
dreams
many
forms
of
mental
alienation
are
nothing
else
but
from
this
it
results
that
one
of
the
rles
of
the
brain
is
to
limit
the
vision
of
the
mind
to
render
its
action
more
efficacious
this
is
what
we
observe
in
regard
to
the
memory
where
the
rle
of
the
brain
is
to
mask
the
useless
part
of
our
past
in
order
to
allow
only
the
useful
remembrances
to
appear
certain
useless
recollections
or
dream
remembrances
manage
nevertheless
to
appear
also
and
to
form
a
vague
fringe
around
the
distinct
recollections
it
would
not
be
at
all
surprising
if
perceptions
of
the
organs
of
our
senses
useful
perceptions
were
the
result
of
a
selection
or
of
a
canalization
worked
by
the
organs
of
our
senses
in
the
interest
of
our
action
but
that
there
should
yet
be
around
those
perceptions
a
fringe
of
vague
perceptions
capable
of
becoming
more
distinct
in
extraordinary
abnormal
cases
those
would
be
precisely
the
cases
with
which
psychical
research
would
deal
this
conception
of
mental
action
forms
as
will
be
seen
the
foundation
of
the
theory
of
dreams
which
professor
bergson
first
presented
in
a
lecture
before
the
institut
psychologique
march
it
was
published
in
the
revue
scientifique
of
june
an
english
translation
revised
by
the
author
and
printed
in
the
independent
of
october
and
here
appears
for
the
first
time
in
book
form
in
this
essay
professor
bergson
made
several
contributions
to
our
knowledge
of
dreams
he
showed
in
the
first
place
that
dreaming
is
not
so
unlike
the
ordinary
process
of
perception
as
had
been
hitherto
supposed
both
use
sense
impressions
as
crude
material
to
be
molded
and
defined
by
the
aid
of
memory
images
here
too
he
set
forth
the
idea
which
he
so
far
as
i
know
was
the
first
to
formulate
that
sleep
is
a
state
of
disinterestedness
a
theory
which
has
since
been
adopted
by
several
psychologists
in
this
address
also
was
brought
into
consideration
for
the
first
time
the
idea
that
the
self
may
go
through
different
degrees
of
tension--a
theory
referred
to
in
his
matter
and
memory
its
chief
interest
for
the
general
reader
will
however
lie
in
the
explanation
it
gives
him
of
the
cause
of
some
of
his
familiar
dreams
he
may
by
practice
become
the
interpreter
of
his
own
visions
and
so
come
to
an
understanding
of
the
vagaries
of
that
mysterious
and
inseparable
companion
his
dream-self
edwin

dreams
the
subject
which
i
have
to
discuss
here
is
so
complex
it
raises
so
many
questions
of
all
kinds
difficult
obscure
some
psychological
others
physiological
and
metaphysical
in
order
to
be
treated
in
a
complete
manner
it
requires
such
a
long
development--and
we
have
so
little
space
that
i
shall
ask
your
permission
to
dispense
with
all
preamble
to
set
aside
unessentials
and
to
go
at
once
to
the
heart
of
the
question
a
dream
is
this
i
perceive
objects
and
there
is
nothing
there
i
see
men
i
seem
to
speak
to
them
and
i
hear
what
they
answer
there
is
no
one
there
and
i
have
not
spoken
it
is
all
as
if
real
things
and
real
persons
were
there
then
on
waking
all
has
disappeared
both
persons
and
things
how
does
this
happen
but
first
is
it
true
that
there
is
nothing
there
i
mean
is
there
not
presented
a
certain
sense
material
to
our
eyes
to
our
ears
to
our
touch
etc
during
sleep
as
well
as
during
waking
close
the
eyes
and
look
attentively
at
what
goes
on
in
the
field
of
our
vision
many
persons
questioned
on
this
point
would
say
that
nothing
goes
on
that
they
see
nothing
no
wonder
at
this
for
a
certain
amount
of
practise
is
necessary
to
be
able
to
observe
oneself
satisfactorily
but
just
give
the
requisite
effort
of
attention
and
you
will
distinguish
little
by
little
many
things
first
in
general
a
black
background
upon
this
black
background
occasionally
brilliant
points
which
come
and
go
rising
and
descending
slowly
and
sedately
more
often
spots
of
many
colors
sometimes
very
dull
sometimes
on
the
contrary
with
certain
people
so
brilliant
that
reality
cannot
compare
with
it
these
spots
spread
and
shrink
changing
form
and
color
constantly
displacing
one
another
sometimes
the
change
is
slow
and
gradual
sometimes
again
it
is
a
whirlwind
of
vertiginous
rapidity
whence
comes
all
this
phantasmagoria
the
physiologists
and
the
psychologists
have
studied
this
play
of
colors
ocular
spectra
colored
spots
phosphenes
such
are
the
names
that
they
have
given
to
the
phenomenon
they
explain
it
either
by
the
slight
modifications
which
occur
ceaselessly
in
the
retinal
circulation
or
by
the
pressure
that
the
closed
lid
exerts
upon
the
eyeball
causing
a
mechanical
excitation
of
the
optic
nerve
but
the
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
and
the
name
that
is
given
to
it
matters
little
it
occurs
universally
and
it
constitutes--i
may
say
at
once--the
principal
material
of
which
we
shape
our
dreams
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
m
alfred
maury
and
about
the
same
time
m
dhervey
of
st
denis
had
observed
that
at
the
moment
of
falling
asleep
these
colored
spots
and
moving
forms
consolidate
fix
themselves
take
on
definite
outlines
the
outlines
of
the
objects
and
of
the
persons
which
people
our
dreams
but
this
is
an
observation
to
be
accepted
with
caution
since
it
emanates
from
psychologists
already
half
asleep
more
recently
an
american
psychologist
professor
ladd
of
yale
has
devised
a
more
rigorous
method
but
of
difficult
application
because
it
requires
a
sort
of
training
it
consists
in
acquiring
the
habit
on
awakening
in
the
morning
of
keeping
the
eyes
closed
and
retaining
for
some
minutes
the
dream
that
is
fading
from
the
field
of
vision
and
soon
would
doubtless
have
faded
from
that
of
memory
then
one
sees
the
figures
and
objects
of
the
dream
melt
away
little
by
little
into
phosphenes
identifying
themselves
with
the
colored
spots
that
the
eye
really
perceives
when
the
lids
are
closed
one
reads
for
example
a
newspaper
that
is
the
dream
one
awakens
and
there
remains
of
the
newspaper
whose
definite
outlines
are
erased
only
a
white
spot
with
black
marks
here
and
there
that
is
the
reality
or
our
dream
takes
us
upon
the
open
sea--round
about
us
the
ocean
spreads
its
waves
of
yellowish
gray
with
here
and
there
a
crown
of
white
foam
on
awakening
it
is
all
lost
in
a
great
spot
half
yellow
and
half
gray
sown
with
brilliant
points
the
spot
was
there
the
brilliant
points
were
there
there
was
really
presented
to
our
perceptions
in
sleep
a
visual
dust
and
it
was
this
dust
which
served
for
the
fabrication
of
our
dreams
will
this
alone
suffice
still
considering
the
sensation
of
sight
we
ought
to
add
to
these
visual
sensations
which
we
may
call
internal
all
those
which
continue
to
come
to
us
from
an
external
source
the
eyes
when
closed
still
distinguish
light
from
shade
and
even
to
a
certain
extent
different
lights
from
one
another
these
sensations
of
light
emanating
from
without
are
at
the
bottom
of
many
of
our
dreams
a
candle
abruptly
lighted
in
the
room
will
for
example
suggest
to
the
sleeper
if
his
slumber
is
not
too
deep
a
dream
dominated
by
the
image
of
fire
the
idea
of
a
burning
building
permit
me
to
cite
to
you
two
observations
of
m
tissi
on
this
subject
b----
lon
dreams
that
the
theater
of
alexandria
is
on
fire
the
flame
lights
up
the
whole
place
all
of
a
sudden
he
finds
himself
transported
to
the
midst
of
the
fountain
in
the
public
square
a
line
of
fire
runs
along
the
chains
which
connect
the
great
posts
placed
around
the
margin
then
he
finds
himself
in
paris
at
the
exposition
which
is
on
fire
he
takes
part
in
terrible
scenes
etc
he
wakes
with
a
start
his
eyes
catch
the
rays
of
light
projected
by
the
dark
lantern
which
the
night
nurse
flashes
toward
his
bed
in
passing
m----
bertrand
dreams
that
he
is
in
the
marine
infantry
where
he
formerly
served
he
goes
to
fort-de-france
to
toulon
to
loriet
to
crimea
to
constantinople
he
sees
lightning
he
hears
thunder
he
takes
part
in
a
combat
in
which
he
sees
fire
leap
from
the
mouths
of
cannon
he
wakes
with
a
start
like
b
he
was
wakened
by
a
flash
of
light
projected
from
the
dark
lantern
of
the
night
nurse
such
are
often
the
dreams
provoked
by
a
bright
and
sudden
light
very
different
are
those
which
are
suggested
by
a
mild
and
continuous
light
like
that
of
the
moon
a
krauss
tells
how
one
day
on
awakening
he
perceived
that
he
was
extending
his
arm
toward
what
in
his
dream
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
image
of
a
young
girl
little
by
little
this
image
melted
into
that
of
the
full
moon
which
darted
its
rays
upon
him
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
one
might
cite
other
examples
of
dreams
where
the
rays
of
the
moon
caressing
the
eyes
of
the
sleeper
evoked
before
him
virginal
apparitions
may
we
not
suppose
that
such
might
have
been
the
origin
in
antiquity
of
the
fable
of
endymion--endymion
the
shepherd
lapped
in
perpetual
slumber
for
whom
the
goddess
selene
that
is
the
moon
is
smitten
with
love
while
he
sleeps
i
have
spoken
of
visual
sensations
they
are
the
principal
ones
but
the
auditory
sensations
nevertheless
play
a
rle
first
the
ear
has
also
its
internal
sensations
sensations
of
buzzing
of
tinkling
of
whistling
difficult
to
isolate
and
to
perceive
while
awake
but
which
are
clearly
distinguished
in
sleep
besides
that
we
continue
when
once
asleep
to
hear
external
sounds
the
creaking
of
furniture
the
crackling
of
the
fire
the
rain
beating
against
the
window
the
wind
playing
its
chromatic
scale
in
the
chimney
such
are
the
sounds
which
come
to
the
ear
of
the
sleeper
and
which
the
dream
converts
according
to
circumstances
into
conversation
singing
cries
music
etc
scissors
were
struck
against
the
tongs
in
the
ears
of
alfred
maury
while
he
slept
immediately
he
dreamt
that
he
heard
the
tocsin
and
took
part
in
the
events
of
june
such
observations
and
experiences
are
numerous
but
let
us
hasten
to
say
that
sounds
do
not
play
in
our
dreams
so
important
a
rle
as
colors
our
dreams
are
above
all
visual
and
even
more
visual
than
we
think
to
whom
has
it
not
happened--as
m
max
simon
has
remarked--to
talk
in
a
dream
with
a
certain
person
to
dream
a
whole
conversation
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
singular
phenomenon
strikes
the
attention
of
the
dreamer
he
perceives
that
he
does
not
speak
that
he
has
not
spoken
that
his
interlocutor
has
not
uttered
a
single
word
that
it
was
a
simple
exchange
of
thought
between
them
a
very
clear
conversation
in
which
nevertheless
nothing
has
been
heard
the
phenomenon
is
easily
enough
explained
it
is
in
general
necessary
for
us
to
hear
sounds
in
a
dream
from
nothing
we
can
make
nothing
and
when
we
are
not
provided
with
sonorous
material
a
dream
would
find
it
hard
to
manufacture
sonority
there
is
much
more
to
say
about
the
sensations
of
touch
than
about
those
of
hearing
but
i
must
hasten
we
could
talk
for
hours
about
the
singular
phenomena
which
result
from
the
confused
sensations
of
touch
during
sleep
these
sensations
mingling
with
the
images
which
occupy
our
visual
field
modify
them
or
arrange
them
in
their
own
way
often
in
the
midst
of
the
night
the
contact
of
our
body
with
its
light
clothing
makes
itself
felt
all
at
once
and
reminds
us
that
we
are
lightly
clothed
then
if
our
dream
is
at
the
moment
taking
us
through
the
street
it
is
in
this
simple
attire
that
we
present
ourselves
to
the
gaze
of
the
passers-by
without
their
appearing
to
be
astonished
by
it
we
are
ourselves
astonished
in
the
dream
but
that
never
appears
to
astonish
other
people
i
cite
this
dream
because
it
is
frequent
there
is
another
which
many
of
us
must
have
experienced
it
consists
of
feeling
oneself
flying
through
the
air
or
floating
in
space
once
having
had
this
dream
one
may
be
quite
sure
that
it
will
reappear
and
every
time
that
it
recurs
the
dreamer
reasons
in
this
way
i
have
had
before
now
in
a
dream
the
illusion
of
flying
or
floating
but
this
time
it
is
the
real
thing
it
has
certainly
proved
to
me
that
we
may
free
ourselves
from
the
law
of
gravitation
now
if
you
wake
abruptly
from
this
dream
you
can
analyze
it
without
difficulty
if
you
undertake
it
immediately
you
will
see
that
you
feel
very
clearly
that
your
feet
are
not
touching
the
earth
and
nevertheless
not
believing
yourself
asleep
you
have
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
you
are
lying
down
therefore
since
you
are
not
lying
down
and
yet
your
feet
do
not
feel
the
resistance
of
the
ground
the
conclusion
is
natural
that
you
are
floating
in
space
notice
this
also
when
levitation
accompanies
the
flight
it
is
on
one
side
only
that
you
make
an
effort
to
fly
and
if
you
woke
at
that
moment
you
would
find
that
this
side
is
the
one
on
which
you
are
lying
and
that
the
sensation
of
effort
for
flight
coincides
with
the
real
sensation
given
you
by
the
pressure
of
your
body
against
the
bed
this
sensation
of
pressure
dissociated
from
its
cause
becomes
a
pure
and
simple
sensation
of
effort
and
joined
to
the
illusion
of
floating
in
space
is
sufficient
to
produce
the
dream
it
is
interesting
to
see
that
these
sensations
of
pressure
mounting
so
to
speak
to
the
level
of
our
visual
field
and
taking
advantage
of
the
luminous
dust
which
fills
it
effect
its
transformation
into
forms
and
colors
m
max
simon
tells
of
having
a
strange
and
somewhat
painful
dream
he
dreamt
that
he
was
confronted
by
two
piles
of
golden
coins
side
by
side
and
of
unequal
height
which
for
some
reason
or
other
he
had
to
equalize
but
he
could
not
accomplish
it
this
produced
a
feeling
of
extreme
anguish
this
feeling
growing
moment
by
moment
finally
awakened
him
he
then
perceived
that
one
of
his
legs
was
caught
by
the
folds
of
the
bedclothes
in
such
a
way
that
his
two
feet
were
on
different
levels
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
bring
them
together
from
this
the
sensation
of
inequality
making
an
irruption
into
the
visual
field
and
there
encountering
such
at
least
is
the
hypothesis
which
i
propose
one
or
more
yellow
spots
expressed
itself
visually
by
the
inequality
of
the
two
piles
of
gold
pieces
there
is
then
immanent
in
the
tactile
sensations
during
sleep
a
tendency
to
visualize
themselves
and
enter
in
this
form
into
the
dream
more
important
still
than
the
tactile
sensations
properly
speaking
are
the
sensations
which
pertain
to
what
is
sometimes
called
internal
touch
deep-seated
sensations
emanating
from
all
points
of
the
organism
and
more
particularly
from
the
viscera
one
cannot
imagine
the
degree
of
sharpness
of
acuity
which
may
be
obtained
during
sleep
by
these
interior
sensations
they
doubtless
already
exist
as
well
during
waking
but
we
are
then
distracted
by
practical
action
we
live
outside
of
ourselves
but
sleep
makes
us
retire
into
ourselves
it
happens
frequently
that
persons
subject
to
laryngitis
amygdalitis
etc
dream
that
they
are
attacked
by
their
affection
and
experience
a
disagreeable
tingling
on
the
side
of
their
throat
when
awakened
they
feel
nothing
more
and
believe
it
an
illusion
but
a
few
hours
later
the
illusion
becomes
a
reality
there
are
cited
maladies
and
grave
accidents
attacks
of
epilepsy
cardiac
affections
etc
which
have
been
foreseen
and
as
it
were
prophesied
in
dreams
we
need
not
be
astonished
then
that
philosophers
like
schopenhauer
have
seen
in
the
dream
a
reverberation
in
the
heart
of
consciousness
of
perturbations
emanating
from
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
and
that
psychologists
like
schemer
have
attributed
to
each
of
our
organs
the
power
of
provoking
a
well-determined
kind
of
dream
which
represents
it
as
it
were
symbolically
and
finally
that
physicians
like
artigues
have
written
treatises
on
the
semeiological
value
of
dreams
that
is
to
say
the
method
of
making
use
of
dreams
for
the
diagnosis
of
certain
maladies
more
recently
m
tissi
of
whom
we
have
just
spoken
has
shown
how
specific
dreams
are
connected
with
affections
of
the
digestive
respiratory
and
circulatory
apparatus
i
will
summarize
what
i
have
just
been
saying
when
we
are
sleeping
naturally
it
is
not
necessary
to
believe
as
has
often
been
supposed
that
our
senses
are
closed
to
external
sensations
our
senses
continue
to
be
active
they
act
it
is
true
with
less
precision
but
in
compensation
they
embrace
a
host
of
subjective
impressions
which
pass
unperceived
when
we
are
awake--for
then
we
live
in
a
world
of
perceptions
common
to
all
men--and
which
reappear
in
sleep
when
we
live
only
for
ourselves
thus
our
faculty
of
sense
perception
far
from
being
narrowed
during
sleep
at
all
points
is
on
the
contrary
extended
at
least
in
certain
directions
in
its
field
of
operations
it
is
true
that
it
often
loses
in
energy
in
tension
what
it
gains
in
extension
it
brings
to
us
only
confused
impressions
these
impressions
are
the
materials
of
our
dreams
but
they
are
only
the
materials
they
do
not
suffice
to
produce
them
they
do
not
suffice
to
produce
them
because
they
are
vague
and
indeterminate
to
speak
only
of
those
that
play
the
principal
rle
the
changing
colors
and
forms
which
deploy
before
us
when
our
eyes
are
closed
never
have
well-defined
contours
here
are
black
lines
upon
a
white
background
they
may
represent
to
the
dreamer
the
page
of
a
book
or
the
facade
of
a
new
house
with
dark
blinds
or
any
number
of
other
things
who
will
choose
what
is
the
form
that
will
imprint
its
decision
upon
the
indecision
of
this
material
this
form
is
our
memory
let
us
note
first
that
the
dream
in
general
creates
nothing
doubtless
there
may
be
cited
some
examples
of
artistic
literary
and
scientific
production
in
dreams
i
will
recall
only
the
well-known
anecdote
told
of
tartini
a
violinist-composer
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
he
was
trying
to
compose
a
sonata
and
the
muse
remained
recalcitrant
he
went
to
sleep
and
he
saw
in
a
dream
the
devil
who
seized
his
violin
and
played
with
master
hand
the
desired
sonata
tartini
wrote
it
out
from
memory
when
he
woke
it
has
come
to
us
under
the
name
of
the
devils
sonata
but
it
is
very
difficult
in
regard
to
such
old
cases
to
distinguish
between
history
and
legend
we
should
have
auto-observations
of
certain
authenticity
now
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
anything
more
than
that
of
the
contemporary
english
novelist
stevenson
in
a
very
curious
essay
entitled
a
chapter
on
dreams
this
author
who
is
endowed
with
a
rare
talent
for
analysis
explains
to
us
how
the
most
original
of
his
stories
have
been
composed
or
at
least
sketched
in
dreams
but
read
the
chapter
carefully
you
will
see
that
at
a
certain
time
in
his
life
stevenson
had
come
to
be
in
an
habitual
psychical
state
where
it
was
very
hard
for
him
to
say
whether
he
was
sleeping
or
waking
that
appears
to
me
to
be
the
truth
when
the
mind
creates
i
would
say
when
it
is
capable
of
giving
the
effort
of
organization
and
synthesis
which
is
necessary
to
triumph
over
a
certain
difficulty
to
solve
a
problem
to
produce
a
living
work
of
the
imagination
we
are
not
really
asleep
or
at
least
that
part
of
ourselves
which
labors
is
not
the
same
as
that
which
sleeps
we
cannot
say
then
that
it
is
a
dream
in
sleep
properly
speaking
in
sleep
which
absorbs
our
whole
personality
it
is
memories
and
only
memories
which
weave
the
web
of
our
dreams
but
often
we
do
not
recognize
them
they
may
be
very
old
memories
forgotten
during
waking
hours
drawn
from
the
most
obscure
depths
of
our
past
they
may
be
often
are
memories
of
objects
that
we
have
perceived
distractedly
almost
unconsciously
while
awake
or
they
may
be
fragments
of
broken
memories
which
have
been
picked
up
here
and
there
and
mingled
by
chance
composing
an
incoherent
and
unrecognizable
whole
before
these
bizarre
assemblages
of
images
which
present
no
plausible
significance
our
intelligence
which
is
far
from
surrendering
the
reasoning
faculty
during
sleep
as
has
been
asserted
seeks
an
explanation
tries
to
fill
the
lacun
it
fills
them
by
calling
up
other
memories
which
presenting
themselves
often
with
the
same
deformations
and
the
same
incoherences
as
the
preceding
demand
in
their
turn
a
new
explanation
and
so
on
indefinitely
but
i
do
not
insist
upon
this
point
for
the
moment
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
say
in
order
to
answer
the
question
which
i
have
propounded
that
the
formative
power
of
the
materials
furnished
to
the
dream
by
the
different
senses
the
power
which
converts
into
precise
determined
objects
the
vague
and
indistinct
sensations
that
the
dreamer
receives
from
his
eyes
his
ears
and
the
whole
surface
and
interior
of
his
body
is
the
memory
memory
in
a
waking
state
we
have
indeed
memories
which
appear
and
disappear
occupying
our
mind
in
turn
but
they
are
always
memories
which
are
closely
connected
with
our
present
situation
our
present
occupation
our
present
action
i
recall
at
this
moment
the
book
of
m
dhervey
on
dreams
that
is
because
i
am
discussing
the
subject
of
dreams
and
this
act
orients
in
a
certain
particular
direction
the
activity
of
my
memory
the
memories
that
we
evoke
while
waking
however
distant
they
may
at
first
appear
to
be
from
the
present
action
are
always
connected
with
it
in
some
way
what
is
the
rle
of
memory
in
an
animal
it
is
to
recall
to
him
in
any
circumstance
the
advantageous
or
injurious
consequences
which
have
formerly
arisen
in
analogous
circumstances
in
order
to
instruct
him
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
in
man
memory
is
doubtless
less
the
slave
of
action
but
still
it
sticks
to
it
our
memories
at
any
given
moment
form
a
solid
whole
a
pyramid
so
to
speak
whose
point
is
inserted
precisely
into
our
present
action
but
behind
the
memories
which
are
concerned
in
our
occupations
and
are
revealed
by
means
of
it
there
are
others
thousands
of
others
stored
below
the
scene
illuminated
by
consciousness
yes
i
believe
indeed
that
all
our
past
life
is
there
preserved
even
to
the
most
infinitesimal
details
and
that
we
forget
nothing
and
that
all
that
we
have
felt
perceived
thought
willed
from
the
first
awakening
of
our
consciousness
survives
indestructibly
but
the
memories
which
are
preserved
in
these
obscure
depths
are
there
in
the
state
of
invisible
phantoms
they
aspire
perhaps
to
the
light
but
they
do
not
even
try
to
rise
to
it
they
know
that
it
is
impossible
and
that
i
as
a
living
and
acting
being
have
something
else
to
do
than
to
occupy
myself
with
them
but
suppose
that
at
a
given
moment
i
become
disinterested
in
the
present
situation
in
the
present
action--in
short
in
all
which
previously
has
fixed
and
guided
my
memory
suppose
in
other
words
that
i
am
asleep
then
these
memories
perceiving
that
i
have
taken
away
the
obstacle
have
raised
the
trapdoor
which
has
kept
them
beneath
the
floor
of
consciousness
arise
from
the
depths
they
rise
they
move
they
perform
in
the
night
of
unconsciousness
a
great
dance
macabre
they
rush
together
to
the
door
which
has
been
left
ajar
they
all
want
to
get
through
but
they
cannot
there
are
too
many
of
them
from
the
multitudes
which
are
called
which
will
be
chosen
it
is
not
hard
to
say
formerly
when
i
was
awake
the
memories
which
forced
their
way
were
those
which
could
involve
claims
of
relationship
with
the
present
situation
with
what
i
saw
and
heard
around
me
now
it
is
more
vague
images
which
occupy
my
sight
more
indecisive
sounds
which
affect
my
ear
more
indistinct
touches
which
are
distributed
over
the
surface
of
my
body
but
there
are
also
the
more
numerous
sensations
which
arise
from
the
deepest
parts
of
the
organism
so
then
among
the
phantom
memories
which
aspire
to
fill
themselves
with
color
with
sonority
in
short
with
materiality
the
only
ones
that
succeed
are
those
which
can
assimilate
themselves
with
the
color-dust
that
we
perceive
the
external
and
internal
sensations
that
we
catch
etc
and
which
besides
respond
to
the
affective
tone
of
our
general
sensibility
when
this
union
is
effected
between
the
memory
and
the
sensation
we
have
a
dream
in
a
poetic
page
of
the
enneades
the
philosopher
plotinus
interpreter
and
continuator
of
plato
explains
to
us
how
men
come
to
life
nature
he
says
sketches
the
living
bodies
but
sketches
them
only
left
to
her
own
forces
she
can
never
complete
the
task
on
the
other
hand
souls
inhabit
the
world
of
ideas
incapable
in
themselves
of
acting
not
even
thinking
of
action
they
float
beyond
space
and
beyond
time
but
among
all
the
bodies
there
are
some
which
specially
respond
by
their
form
to
the
aspirations
of
some
particular
souls
and
among
these
souls
there
are
those
which
recognize
themselves
in
some
particular
body
the
body
which
does
not
come
altogether
viable
from
the
hand
of
nature
rises
toward
the
soul
which
might
give
it
complete
life
and
the
soul
looking
upon
the
body
and
believing
that
it
perceives
its
own
image
as
in
a
mirror
and
attracted
fascinated
by
the
image
lets
itself
fall
it
falls
and
this
fall
is
life
i
may
compare
to
these
detached
souls
the
memories
plunged
in
the
obscurity
of
the
unconscious
on
the
other
hand
our
nocturnal
sensations
resemble
these
incomplete
bodies
the
sensation
is
warm
colored
vibrant
and
almost
living
but
vague
the
memory
is
complete
but
airy
and
lifeless
the
sensation
wishes
to
find
a
form
on
which
to
mold
the
vagueness
of
its
contours
the
memory
would
obtain
matter
to
fill
it
to
ballast
it
in
short
to
realize
it
they
are
drawn
toward
each
other
and
the
phantom
memory
incarnated
in
the
sensation
which
brings
to
it
flesh
and
blood
becomes
a
being
with
a
life
of
its
own
a
dream
the
birth
of
a
dream
is
then
no
mystery
it
resembles
the
birth
of
all
our
perceptions
the
mechanism
of
the
dream
is
the
same
in
general
as
that
of
normal
perception
when
we
perceive
a
real
object
what
we
actually
see--the
sensible
matter
of
our
perception--is
very
little
in
comparison
with
what
our
memory
adds
to
it
when
you
read
a
book
when
you
look
through
your
newspaper
do
you
suppose
that
all
the
printed
letters
really
come
into
your
consciousness
in
that
case
the
whole
day
would
hardly
be
long
enough
for
you
to
read
a
paper
the
truth
is
that
you
see
in
each
word
and
even
in
each
member
of
a
phrase
only
some
letters
or
even
some
characteristic
marks
just
enough
to
permit
you
to
divine
the
rest
all
of
the
rest
that
you
think
you
see
you
really
give
yourself
as
an
hallucination
there
are
numerous
and
decisive
experiments
which
leave
no
doubt
on
this
point
i
will
cite
only
those
of
goldscheider
and
mller
these
experimenters
wrote
or
printed
some
formulas
in
common
use
positively
no
admission
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
etc
but
they
took
care
to
write
the
words
incorrectly
changing
and
above
all
omitting
letters
these
sentences
were
exposed
in
a
darkened
room
the
person
who
served
as
the
subject
of
the
experiment
was
placed
before
them
and
did
not
know
of
course
what
had
been
written
then
the
inscription
was
illuminated
by
the
electric
light
for
a
very
short
time
too
short
for
the
observer
to
be
able
to
perceive
really
all
the
letters
they
began
by
determining
experimentally
the
time
necessary
for
seeing
one
letter
of
the
alphabet
it
was
then
easy
to
arrange
it
so
that
the
observer
could
not
perceive
more
than
eight
or
ten
letters
for
example
of
the
thirty
or
forty
letters
composing
the
formula
usually
however
he
read
the
entire
phrase
without
difficulty
but
that
is
not
for
us
the
most
instructive
point
of
this
experiment
if
the
observer
is
asked
what
are
the
letters
that
he
is
sure
of
having
seen
these
may
be
of
course
the
letters
really
written
but
there
may
be
also
absent
letters
either
letters
that
we
replaced
by
others
or
that
have
simply
been
omitted
thus
an
observer
will
see
quite
distinctly
in
full
light
a
letter
which
does
not
exist
if
this
letter
on
account
of
the
general
sense
ought
to
enter
into
the
phrase
the
characters
which
have
really
affected
the
eye
have
been
utilized
only
to
serve
as
an
indication
to
the
unconscious
memory
of
the
observer
this
memory
discovering
the
appropriate
remembrance
ie
finding
the
formula
to
which
these
characters
give
a
start
toward
realization
projects
the
remembrance
externally
in
an
hallucinatory
form
it
is
this
remembrance
and
not
the
words
themselves
that
the
observer
has
seen
it
is
thus
demonstrated
that
rapid
reading
is
in
great
part
a
work
of
divination
but
not
of
abstract
divination
it
is
an
externalization
of
memories
which
take
advantage
to
a
certain
extent
of
the
partial
realization
that
they
find
here
and
there
in
order
to
completely
realize
themselves
thus
in
the
waking
state
and
in
the
knowledge
that
we
get
of
the
real
objects
which
surround
us
an
operation
is
continually
going
on
which
is
of
quite
the
same
nature
as
that
of
the
dream
we
perceive
merely
a
sketch
of
the
object
this
sketch
appeals
to
the
complete
memory
and
this
complete
memory
which
by
itself
was
either
unconscious
or
simply
in
the
thought
state
profits
by
the
occasion
to
come
out
it
is
this
kind
of
hallucination
inserted
and
fitted
into
a
real
frame
that
we
perceive
it
is
a
shorter
process
it
is
very
much
quicker
done
than
to
see
the
thing
itself
besides
there
are
many
interesting
observations
to
be
made
upon
the
conduct
and
attitude
of
the
memory
images
during
this
operation
it
is
not
necessary
to
suppose
that
they
are
in
our
memory
in
a
state
of
inert
impressions
they
are
like
the
steam
in
a
boiler
under
more
or
less
tension
at
the
moment
when
the
perceived
sketch
calls
them
forth
it
is
as
if
they
were
then
grouped
in
families
according
to
their
relationship
and
resemblances
there
are
experiments
of
mnsterberg
earlier
than
those
of
goldscheider
and
mller
which
appear
to
me
to
confirm
this
hypothesis
although
they
were
made
for
a
very
different
purpose
mnsterberg
wrote
the
words
correctly
they
were
besides
not
common
phrases
they
were
isolated
words
taken
by
chance
here
again
the
word
was
exposed
during
the
time
too
short
for
it
to
be
entirely
perceived
now
while
the
observer
was
looking
at
the
written
word
some
one
spoke
in
his
ear
another
word
of
a
very
different
significance
this
is
what
happened
the
observer
declared
that
he
had
seen
a
word
which
was
not
the
written
word
but
which
resembled
it
in
its
general
form
and
which
besides
recalled
by
its
meaning
the
word
which
was
spoken
in
his
ear
for
example
the
word
written
was
tumult
and
the
word
spoken
was
railroad
the
observer
read
tunnel
the
written
word
was
trieste
and
the
spoken
word
was
the
german
verzweiflung
despair
the
observer
read
trost
which
signifies
consolation
it
is
as
if
the
word
railroad
pronounced
in
the
ear
wakened
without
our
knowing
it
hopes
of
conscious
realization
in
a
crowd
of
memories
which
have
some
relationship
with
the
idea
of
railroad
car
rail
trip
etc
but
this
is
only
a
hope
and
the
memory
which
succeeds
in
coming
into
consciousness
is
that
which
the
actually
present
sensation
had
already
begun
to
realize
such
is
the
mechanism
of
true
perception
and
such
is
that
of
the
dream
in
both
cases
there
are
on
one
hand
real
impressions
made
upon
the
organs
of
sense
and
upon
the
other
memories
which
encase
themselves
in
the
impression
and
profit
by
its
vitality
to
return
again
to
life
but
then
what
is
the
essential
difference
between
perceiving
and
dreaming
what
is
sleep
i
do
not
ask
of
course
how
sleep
can
be
explained
physiologically
that
is
a
special
question
and
besides
is
far
from
being
settled
i
ask
what
is
sleep
psychologically
for
our
mind
continues
to
exercise
itself
when
we
are
asleep
and
it
exercises
itself
as
we
have
just
seen
on
elements
analogous
to
those
of
waking
on
sensations
and
memories
and
also
in
an
analogous
manner
combines
them
nevertheless
we
have
on
the
one
hand
normal
perception
and
on
the
other
the
dream
what
is
the
difference
i
repeat
what
are
the
psychological
characteristics
of
the
sleeping
state
we
must
distrust
theories
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
on
this
point
some
say
that
sleep
consists
in
isolating
oneself
from
the
external
world
in
closing
the
senses
to
outside
things
but
we
have
shown
that
our
senses
continue
to
act
during
sleep
that
they
provide
us
with
the
outline
or
at
least
the
point
of
departure
of
most
of
our
dreams
some
say
to
go
to
sleep
is
to
stop
the
action
of
the
superior
faculties
of
the
mind
and
they
talk
of
a
kind
of
momentary
paralysis
of
the
higher
centers
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
much
more
exact
in
a
dream
we
become
no
doubt
indifferent
to
logic
but
not
incapable
of
logic
there
are
dreams
when
we
reason
with
correctness
and
even
with
subtlety
i
might
almost
say
at
the
risk
of
seeming
paradoxical
that
the
mistake
of
the
dreamer
is
often
in
reasoning
too
much
he
would
avoid
the
absurdity
if
he
would
remain
a
simple
spectator
of
the
procession
of
images
which
compose
his
dream
but
when
he
strongly
desires
to
explain
it
his
explanation
intended
to
bind
together
incoherent
images
can
be
nothing
more
than
a
bizarre
reasoning
which
verges
upon
absurdity
i
recognize
indeed
that
our
superior
intellectual
faculties
are
relaxed
in
sleep
that
generally
the
logic
of
a
dreamer
is
feeble
enough
and
often
resembles
a
mere
parody
of
logic
but
one
might
say
as
much
of
all
of
our
faculties
during
sleep
it
is
then
not
by
the
abolition
of
reasoning
any
more
than
by
the
closing
of
the
senses
that
we
characterize
dreaming
something
else
is
essential
we
need
something
more
than
theories
we
need
an
intimate
contact
with
the
facts
one
must
make
the
decisive
experiment
upon
oneself
it
is
necessary
that
on
coming
out
of
a
dream
since
we
cannot
analyze
ourselves
in
the
dream
itself
we
should
watch
the
transition
from
sleeping
to
waking
follow
upon
the
transition
as
closely
as
possible
and
try
to
express
by
words
what
we
experience
in
this
passage
this
is
very
difficult
but
may
be
accomplished
by
forcing
the
attention
permit
then
the
writer
to
take
an
example
from
his
own
personal
experience
and
to
tell
of
a
recent
dream
as
well
as
what
was
accomplished
on
coming
out
of
the
dream
now
the
dreamer
dreamed
that
he
was
speaking
before
an
assembly
that
he
was
making
a
political
speech
before
a
political
assembly
then
in
the
midst
of
the
auditorium
a
murmur
rose
the
murmur
augmented
it
became
a
muttering
then
it
became
a
roar
a
frightful
tumult
and
finally
there
resounded
from
all
parts
timed
to
a
uniform
rhythm
the
cries
out
out
at
that
moment
he
wakened
a
dog
was
baying
in
a
neighboring
garden
and
with
each
one
of
his
wow-wows
one
of
the
cries
of
out
out
seemed
to
be
identical
well
here
was
the
infinitesimal
moment
which
it
is
necessary
to
seize
the
waking
ego
just
reappearing
should
turn
to
the
dreaming
ego
which
is
still
there
and
during
some
instants
at
least
hold
it
without
letting
it
go
i
have
caught
you
at
it
you
thought
it
was
a
crowd
shouting
and
it
was
a
dog
barking
now
i
shall
not
let
go
of
you
until
you
tell
me
just
what
you
were
doing
to
which
the
dreaming
ego
would
answer
i
was
doing
nothing
and
this
is
just
where
you
and
i
differ
from
one
another
you
imagine
that
in
order
to
hear
a
dog
barking
and
to
know
that
it
is
a
dog
that
barks
you
have
nothing
to
do
that
is
a
great
mistake
you
accomplish
without
suspecting
it
a
considerable
effort
you
take
your
entire
memory
all
your
accumulated
experience
and
you
bring
this
formidable
mass
of
memories
to
converge
upon
a
single
point
in
such
a
way
as
to
insert
exactly
in
the
sounds
you
heard
that
one
of
your
memories
which
is
the
most
capable
of
being
adapted
to
it
nay
you
must
obtain
a
perfect
adherence
for
between
the
memory
that
you
evoke
and
the
crude
sensation
that
you
perceive
there
must
not
be
the
least
discrepancy
otherwise
you
would
be
just
dreaming
this
adjustment
you
can
only
obtain
by
an
effort
of
the
memory
and
an
effort
of
the
perception
just
as
the
tailor
who
is
trying
on
a
new
coat
pulls
together
the
pieces
of
cloth
that
he
adjusts
to
the
shape
of
your
body
in
order
to
pin
them
you
exert
then
continually
every
moment
of
the
day
an
enormous
effort
your
life
in
a
waking
state
is
a
life
of
labor
even
when
you
think
you
are
doing
nothing
for
at
every
minute
you
have
to
choose
and
every
minute
exclude
you
choose
among
your
sensations
since
you
reject
from
your
consciousness
a
thousand
subjective
sensations
which
come
back
in
the
night
when
you
sleep
you
choose
and
with
extreme
precision
and
delicacy
among
your
memories
since
you
reject
all
that
do
not
exactly
suit
your
present
state
this
choice
which
you
continually
accomplish
this
adaptation
ceaselessly
renewed
is
the
first
and
most
essential
condition
of
what
is
called
common
sense
but
all
this
keeps
you
in
a
state
of
uninterrupted
tension
you
do
not
feel
it
at
the
moment
any
more
than
you
feel
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
but
it
fatigues
you
in
the
long
run
common
sense
is
very
fatiguing
so
i
repeat
i
differ
from
you
precisely
in
that
i
do
nothing
the
effort
that
you
give
without
cessation
i
simply
abstain
from
giving
in
place
of
attaching
myself
to
life
i
detach
myself
from
it
everything
has
become
indifferent
to
me
i
have
become
disinterested
in
everything
to
sleep
is
to
become
disinterested
one
sleeps
to
the
exact
extent
to
which
he
becomes
disinterested
a
mother
who
sleeps
by
the
side
of
her
child
will
not
stir
at
the
sound
of
thunder
but
the
sigh
of
the
child
will
wake
her
does
she
really
sleep
in
regard
to
her
child
we
do
not
sleep
in
regard
to
what
continues
to
interest
us
you
ask
me
what
it
is
that
i
do
when
i
dream
i
will
tell
you
what
you
do
when
you
are
awake
you
take
me
the
me
of
dreams
me
the
totality
of
your
past
and
you
force
me
by
making
me
smaller
and
smaller
to
fit
into
the
little
circle
that
you
trace
around
your
present
action
that
is
what
it
is
to
be
awake
that
is
what
it
is
to
live
the
normal
psychical
life
it
is
to
battle
it
is
to
will
as
for
the
dream
have
you
really
any
need
that
i
should
explain
it
it
is
the
state
into
which
you
naturally
fall
when
you
let
yourself
go
when
you
no
longer
have
the
power
to
concentrate
yourself
upon
a
single
point
when
you
have
ceased
to
will
what
needs
much
more
to
be
explained
is
the
marvelous
mechanism
by
which
at
any
moment
your
will
obtains
instantly
and
almost
unconsciously
the
concentration
of
all
that
you
have
within
you
upon
one
and
the
same
point
the
point
that
interests
you
but
to
explain
this
is
the
task
of
normal
psychology
of
the
psychology
of
waking
for
willing
and
waking
are
one
and
the
same
thing
this
is
what
the
dreaming
ego
would
say
and
it
would
tell
us
a
great
many
other
things
still
if
we
could
let
it
talk
freely
but
let
us
sum
up
briefly
the
essential
difference
which
separates
a
dream
from
the
waking
state
in
the
dream
the
same
faculties
are
exercised
as
during
waking
but
they
are
in
a
state
of
tension
in
the
one
case
and
of
relaxation
in
the
other
the
dream
consists
of
the
entire
mental
life
minus
the
tension
the
effort
and
the
bodily
movement
we
perceive
still
we
remember
still
we
reason
still
all
this
can
abound
in
the
dream
for
abundance
in
the
domain
of
the
mind
does
not
mean
effort
what
requires
an
effort
is
the
precision
of
adjustment
to
connect
the
sound
of
a
barking
dog
with
the
memory
of
a
crowd
that
murmurs
and
shouts
requires
no
effort
but
in
order
that
this
sound
should
be
perceived
as
the
barking
of
a
dog
a
positive
effort
must
be
made
it
is
this
force
that
the
dreamer
lacks
it
is
by
that
and
by
that
alone
that
he
is
distinguished
from
the
waking
man
from
this
essential
difference
can
be
drawn
a
great
many
others
we
can
come
to
understand
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
dream
but
i
can
only
outline
the
scheme
of
this
study
it
depends
especially
upon
three
points
which
are
the
incoherence
of
dreams
the
abolition
of
the
sense
of
duration
that
often
appears
to
be
manifested
in
dreams
and
finally
the
order
in
which
the
memories
present
themselves
to
the
dreamer
contending
for
the
sensations
present
where
they
are
to
be
embodied
the
incoherence
of
the
dream
seems
to
me
easy
enough
to
explain
as
it
is
characteristic
of
the
dream
not
to
demand
a
complete
adjustment
between
the
memory
image
and
the
sensation
but
on
the
contrary
to
allow
some
play
between
them
very
different
memories
can
suit
the
same
sensation
for
example
there
may
be
in
the
field
of
vision
a
green
spot
with
white
points
this
might
be
a
lawn
spangled
with
white
flowers
it
might
be
a
billiard-table
with
its
balls
it
might
be
a
host
of
other
things
besides
these
different
memory
images
all
capable
of
utilizing
the
same
sensation
chase
after
it
sometimes
they
attain
it
one
after
the
other
and
so
the
lawn
becomes
a
billiard-table
and
we
watch
these
extraordinary
transformations
often
it
is
at
the
same
time
and
altogether
that
these
memory
images
join
the
sensation
and
then
the
lawn
will
be
a
billiard-table
from
this
come
those
absurd
dreams
where
an
object
remains
as
it
is
and
at
the
same
time
becomes
something
else
as
i
have
just
said
the
mind
confronted
by
these
absurd
visions
seeks
an
explanation
and
often
thereby
aggravates
the
incoherence
as
for
the
abolition
of
the
sense
of
time
in
many
of
our
dreams
that
is
another
effect
of
the
same
cause
in
a
few
seconds
a
dream
can
present
to
us
a
series
of
events
which
will
occupy
in
the
waking
state
entire
days
you
know
the
example
cited
by
m
maury
it
has
become
classic
and
although
it
has
been
contested
of
late
i
regard
it
as
probable
because
of
the
great
number
of
analogous
observations
that
i
found
scattered
through
the
literature
of
dreams
but
this
precipitation
of
the
images
is
not
at
all
mysterious
when
we
are
awake
we
live
a
life
in
common
with
our
fellows
our
attention
to
this
external
and
social
life
is
the
great
regulator
of
the
succession
of
our
internal
states
it
is
like
the
balance
wheel
of
a
watch
which
moderates
and
cuts
into
regular
sections
the
undivided
almost
instantaneous
tension
of
the
spring
it
is
this
balance
wheel
which
is
lacking
in
the
dream
acceleration
is
no
more
than
abundance
a
sign
of
force
in
the
domain
of
the
mind
it
is
i
repeat
the
precision
of
adjustment
that
requires
effort
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
dreamer
lacks
he
is
no
longer
capable
of
that
attention
to
life
which
is
necessary
in
order
that
the
inner
may
be
regulated
by
the
outer
and
that
the
internal
duration
fit
exactly
into
the
general
duration
of
things
it
remains
now
to
explain
how
the
peculiar
relaxation
of
the
mind
in
the
dream
accounts
for
the
preference
given
by
the
dreamer
to
one
memory
image
rather
than
others
equally
capable
of
being
inserted
into
the
actual
sensations
there
is
a
current
prejudice
to
the
effect
that
we
dream
mostly
about
the
events
which
have
especially
preoccupied
us
during
the
day
this
is
sometimes
true
but
when
the
psychological
life
of
the
waking
state
thus
prolongs
itself
into
sleep
it
is
because
we
hardly
sleep
a
sleep
filled
with
dreams
of
this
kind
would
be
a
sleep
from
which
we
come
out
quite
fatigued
in
normal
sleep
our
dreams
concern
themselves
rather
other
things
being
equal
with
the
thoughts
which
we
have
passed
through
rapidly
or
upon
objects
which
we
have
perceived
almost
without
paying
attention
to
them
if
we
dream
about
events
of
the
same
day
it
is
the
most
insignificant
facts
and
not
the
most
important
which
have
the
best
chance
of
reappearing
i
agree
entirely
on
this
point
with
the
observation
of
w
robert
of
delage
and
of
freud
i
was
in
the
street
i
was
waiting
for
a
street-car
i
stood
beside
the
track
and
did
not
run
the
least
risk
but
if
at
the
moment
when
the
street-car
passed
the
idea
of
possible
danger
had
crossed
my
mind
or
even
if
my
body
had
instinctively
recoiled
without
my
having
been
conscious
of
feeling
any
fear
i
might
dream
that
night
that
the
car
had
run
over
my
body
i
watch
at
the
bedside
of
an
invalid
whose
condition
is
hopeless
if
at
any
moment
perhaps
without
even
being
aware
of
it
i
had
hoped
against
hope
i
might
dream
that
the
invalid
was
cured
i
should
dream
of
the
cure
in
any
case
more
probably
than
that
i
should
dream
of
the
disease
in
short
the
events
which
reappear
by
preference
in
the
dream
are
those
of
which
we
have
thought
most
distractedly
what
is
there
astonishing
about
that
the
ego
of
the
dream
is
an
ego
that
is
relaxed
the
memories
which
it
gathers
most
readily
are
the
memories
of
relaxation
and
distraction
those
which
do
not
bear
the
mark
of
effort
it
is
true
that
in
very
profound
slumber
the
law
that
regulates
the
reappearance
of
memories
may
be
very
different
we
know
almost
nothing
of
this
profound
slumber
the
dreams
which
fill
it
are
as
a
general
rule
the
dreams
which
we
forget
sometimes
nevertheless
we
recover
something
of
them
and
then
it
is
a
very
peculiar
feeling
strange
indescribable
that
we
experience
it
seems
to
us
that
we
have
returned
from
afar
in
space
and
afar
in
time
these
are
doubtless
very
old
scenes
scenes
of
youth
or
infancy
that
we
live
over
then
in
all
their
details
with
a
mood
which
colors
them
with
that
fresh
sensation
of
infancy
and
youth
that
we
seek
vainly
to
revive
when
awake
it
is
upon
this
profound
slumber
that
psychology
ought
to
direct
its
efforts
not
only
to
study
the
mechanism
of
unconscious
memory
but
to
examine
the
more
mysterious
phenomena
which
are
raised
by
psychical
research
i
do
not
dare
express
an
opinion
upon
phenomena
of
this
class
but
i
cannot
avoid
attaching
some
importance
to
the
observations
gathered
by
so
rigorous
a
method
and
with
such
indefatigable
zeal
by
the
society
for
psychical
research
if
telepathy
influences
our
dreams
it
is
quite
likely
that
in
this
profound
slumber
it
would
have
the
greatest
chance
to
manifest
itself
but
i
repeat
i
cannot
express
an
opinion
upon
this
point
i
have
gone
forward
with
you
as
far
as
i
can
i
stop
upon
the
threshold
of
the
mystery
to
explore
the
most
secret
depths
of
the
unconscious
to
labor
in
what
i
have
just
called
the
subsoil
of
consciousness
that
will
be
the
principal
task
of
psychology
in
the
century
which
is
opening
i
do
not
doubt
that
wonderful
discoveries
await
it
there
as
important
perhaps
as
have
been
in
the
preceding
centuries
the
discoveries
of
the
physical
and
natural
sciences
that
at
least
is
the
promise
which
i
make
for
it
that
is
the
wish
that
in
closing
i
have
for
it
footnotes
authors
note
this
would
be
the
place
where
especially
will
intervene
those
repressed
desires
which
freud
and
certain
other
psychologists
especially
in
america
have
studied
with
such
penetration
and
ingenuity
see
in
particular
the
recent
volumes
of
the
journal
of
abnormal
psychology

in
boston

morton

address
was

of
freud

dreams
die
