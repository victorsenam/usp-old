< in

< of

< led
< at

< to

< while
< the
< study
< of

< has

< as
< the
< dreaming
< of

< out
< of

< grew

< out

< has
< grown--nothing

< books

< made

< decent
< or
< at

< a
< comfortable
< living
< out
< of

< the
< subject
< of

< so

< of

< the

< over
< the
< cause
< of

< of

< is
< the

< point
< of

< brought

< by
< professor
< bergson
< in
< the
< paper
< which
< is
< here
< made
< accessible
< to
< the
< english-reading
< public
< this
< is
< the
< idea
< that
< we
< can
< explore
< the
< unconscious
< substratum
< of
< our
< mentality
< the
< storehouse
< of
< our
< memories
< by
< means
< of
< dreams
< for
< these
< memories
< are
< by
< no
< means
< inert
< but
< have
< as
< it
< were
< a
< life
< and
< purpose
< of
< their
< own
< and
< strive
< to
< rise
< into

< whenever
< they
< get
< a
< chance
< even
< into
< the
< semi-consciousness
< of
< a
< dream
< to
< use
< professor
< bergsons
< striking
< metaphor
< our
< memories
< are
< packed
< away
< under
< pressure
< like
< steam
< in
< a
< boiler
< and
< the
< dream
< is
< their
< escape
< valve
< that
< this
< is
< more
< than
< a
< mere
< metaphor
< has
< been
< proved
< by
< professor
< freud
< and
< others
< of
< the
< vienna
< school
< who
< cure
< cases
< of
< hysteria
< by
< inducing
< the
< patient
< to
< give
< expression
< to
< the
< secret
< anxieties
< and
< emotions
< which
< unknown
< to
< him
< have
< been
< preying
< upon
< his
< mind
< the
< clue
< to
< these
< disturbing
< thoughts
< is
< generally
< obtained
< in
< dreams
< or
< similar
< states
< of
< relaxed
< consciousness
< according
< to
< the
< freudians
< a
< dream
< always
< means
< something
< but
< never
< what
< it
< appears
< to
< mean
< it
< is
< symbolic
< and
< expresses
< desires
< or
< fears
< which
< we
< refuse
< ordinarily
< to
< admit
< to
< consciousness
< either
< because
< they
< are
< painful
< or
< because
< they
< are
< repugnant
< to
< our
< moral
< nature
< a
< watchman
< is
< stationed
< at
< the
< gate
< of
< consciousness
< to
< keep
< them
< back
< but
< sometimes
< these
< unwelcome
< intruders
< slip
< past
< him
< in
< disguise
< in
< the
< hands
< of
< fanatical
< freudians
< this
< theory
< has
< developed
< the
< wildest
< extravagancies
< and
< the
< voluminous
< literature
< of
< psycho-analysis
< contains
< much
< that
< seems
< to
< the
< layman
< quite
< as
< absurd
< as
< the
< stuff
< which
< fills
< the
< twenty-five
< cent
< dream
< book
< it
< is
< impossible
< to
< believe
< that
< the
< subconsciousness
< of
< every
< one
< of
< us
< contains
< nothing
< but
< the
< foul
< and
< monstrous
< specimens
< which
< they
< dredge
< up
< from
< the
< mental
< depths
< of
< their
< neuropathic
< patients
< and
< exhibit
< with
< such
< pride
< bergsons
< view
< seems
< to
< me
< truer
< as
< it
< is
< certainly
< more
< agreeable
< that
< we
< keep
< stored
< away
< somewhere
< all
< our
< memories
< the
< good
< as
< well
< as
< the
< evil
< the
< pleasant
< together
< with
< the
< unpleasant
< there
< may
< be
< nightmares
< down
< cellar
< as
< we
< thought
< as
< a
< child
< but
< even
< in
< those
< days
< we
< knew
< how
< to
< dodge
< them
< when
< we
< went
< after
< apples
< that
< is
< take
< down
< a
< light
< and
< slam
< the
< door
< quickly
< on
< coming
< up
< maeterlinck
< too
< knew
< this
< trick
< of
< our
< childhood
< when
< in
< the
< palace
< of
< night
< scene
< of
< his
< fairy
< play
< the
< redoubtable
< tyltyl
< unlocks
< the
< cage
< where
< are
< confined
< the
< nightmares
< and
< all
< other
< evil
< imaginings
< he
< shuts
< the
< door
< in
< time
< to
< keep
< them
< in
< and
< then
< opens
< another
< revealing
< a
< lovely
< garden
< full
< of
< blue
< birds
< which
< though
< they
< fade
< and
< die
< when
< brought
< into
< the
< light
< of
< common
< day
< yet
< encourage
< him
< to
< continue
< his
< search
< for
< the
< blue
< bird
< that
< never
< fades
< but
< lives
< everlastingly
< the
< new
< science
< of
< dreams
< is
< giving
< a
< deeper
< significance
< to
< the
< trite
< wish
< of
< good
< night
< and

< once
< for

< and

< thereafter
< but
< mark

< is
< as

< as

< that
< never

< and
< knows
< no

< between

< the

< to

< the

< developed

< as

< go
< for

< came

< force
< of

< felt

< bergson
< has
< been

< commit

< on
< the
< question
< of
< immortality
< but
< he
< of
< late
< has
< become
< quite
< convinced
< of
< it
< he
< even
< goes
< so
< far
< as
< to
< think
< it
< possible
< that
< we
< may
< find
< experimental
< evidence
< of
< personal
< persistence
< after
< death
< this
< at
< least
< we
< might
< infer
< from
< his
< recent
< acceptance
< of
< the
< presidency
< of
< the
< british
< society
< for
< psychical
< research
< in
< his
< opening
< address
< before
< the
< society
< may
< he
< discussed
< the
< question
< of
< telepathy
< and
< in
< that
< connection
< he
< explained
< his
< theory
< of
< the
< relation
< of
< mind
< and
< brain
< in
< the
< following
< language
< i
< quote
< from
< the
< report
< in
< the
< london
< times
< the
< rle
< of
< the
< brain
< is
< to
< bring
< back
< the
< remembrance
< of
< an
< action
< to
< prolong
< the
< remembrance
< in
< movements
< if
< one
< could
< see
< all
< that
< takes
< place
< in
< the
< interior
< of
< the
< brain
< one
< would
< find
< that
< that
< which
< takes
< place
< there
< corresponds
< to
< a
< small
< part
< only
< of
< the
< life
< of
< the
< mind
< the
< brain
< simply
< extracts
< from
< the
< life
< of
< the
< mind
< that
< which
< is
< capable
< of
< representation
< in
< movement
< the
< cerebral
< life
< is
< to
< the
< mental
< life
< what
< the
< movements
< of
< the
< baton
< of
< a
< conductor
< are
< to
< the
< symphony
< the
< brain
< then
< is
< that
< which
< allows
< the
< mind
< to
< adjust
< itself
< exactly
< to
< circumstances
< it
< is
< the
< organ
< of
< attention
< to
< life
< should
< it
< become
< deranged
< however
< slightly
< the
< mind
< is
< no
< longer
< fitted
< to
< the
< circumstances
< it
< wanders
< dreams
< many
< forms
< of
< mental
< alienation
< are
< nothing
< else
< but
< from
< this
< it
< results
< that
< one
< of
< the
< rles
< of
< the
< brain
< is
< to
< limit
< the
< vision
< of
< the
< mind
< to
< render
< its
< action
< more
< efficacious
< this
< is
< what
< we
< observe
< in
< regard
< to
< the
< memory
< where
< the
< rle
< of
< the
< brain
< is
< to
< mask
< the
< useless
< part
< of
< our
< past
< in
< order
< to
< allow
< only
< the
< useful
< remembrances
< to
< appear
< certain
< useless
< recollections
< or
< dream
< remembrances
< manage
< nevertheless
< to
< appear
< also
< and
< to
< form
< a
< vague
< fringe
< around
< the
< distinct
< recollections
< it
< would
< not
< be
< at
< all
< surprising
< if
< perceptions
< of
< the
< organs
< of
< our
< senses
< useful
< perceptions
< were
< the
< result
< of
< a
< selection
< or
< of
< a
< canalization
< worked
< by
< the
< organs
< of
< our
< senses
< in
< the
< interest
< of
< our
< action
< but
< that
< there
< should
< yet
< be
< around
< those
< perceptions
< a
< fringe
< of
< vague
< perceptions
< capable
< of
< becoming
< more
< distinct
< in
< extraordinary
< abnormal
< cases
< those
< would
< be
< precisely
< the
< cases
< with
< which
< psychical
< research
< would
< deal
< this
< conception
< of
< mental
< action
< forms
< as
< will
< be
< seen
< the
< foundation
< of
< the
< theory
< of
< dreams
< which
< professor
< bergson
< first
< presented
< in
< a
< lecture
< before
< the
< institut
< psychologique
< march
< it
< was
< published
< in
< the
< revue
< scientifique
< of
< june
< an
< english
< translation
< revised
< by
< the
< author
< and
< printed
< in
< the
< independent
< of
< october
< and
< here
< appears
< for
< the
< first
< time
< in
< book
< form
< in
< this
< essay
< professor
< bergson
< made
< several
< contributions
< to
< our
< knowledge
< of
< dreams
< he
< showed
< in
< the
< first
< place
< that
< dreaming
< is
< not
< so
< unlike
< the
< ordinary
< process
< of
< perception
< as
< had
< been
< hitherto
< supposed
< both
< use
< sense
< impressions
< as
< crude
< material
< to
< be
< molded
< and
< defined
< by
< the
< aid
< of
< memory
< images
< here
< too
< he
< set
< forth
< the
< idea
< which
< he
< so
< far
< as
< i
< know
< was
< the
< first
< to
< formulate
< that
< sleep
< is
< a
< state
< of
< disinterestedness
< a
< theory
< which
< has
< since
< been
< adopted
< by
< several
< psychologists
< in
< this
< address
< also
< was
< brought
< into
< consideration
< for
< the
< first
< time
< the
< idea
< that
< the
< self
< may
< go
< through
< different
< degrees
< of
< tension--a
< theory
< referred
< to

< the

< and
< to
< go
< at

< to
< the

< of

< a

< this

< not

< to

< that
< they
< see

< no

< for

< to
< be
< able
< to
< observe
< oneself
< satisfactorily
< but
< just
< give
< the
< requisite
< effort
< of
< attention
< and
< you
< will
< distinguish
< little
< by
< little
< many
< things
< first
< in
< general
< a
< black
< background
< upon
< this
< black
< background
< occasionally
< brilliant
< points
< which
< come
< and
< go
< rising
< and
< descending
< slowly
< and
< sedately
< more
< often
< spots
< of
< many
< colors
< sometimes
< very
< dull
< sometimes
< on
< the
< contrary
< with
< certain
< people
< so
< brilliant
< that
< reality
< cannot
< compare
< with
< it
< these
< spots
< spread
< and
< shrink
< changing
< form
< and
< color
< constantly
< displacing
< one
< another
< sometimes
< the
< change
< is
< slow
< and
< gradual
< sometimes
< again
< it
< is
< a
< whirlwind
< of
< vertiginous
< rapidity
< whence
< comes
< all
< this
< phantasmagoria
< the
< physiologists
< and
< the
< psychologists
< have
< studied
< this
< play
< of
< colors
< ocular
< spectra
< colored
< spots
< phosphenes
< such
< are
< the
< names
< that
< they
< have
< given
< to
< the
< phenomenon
< they
< explain
< it
< either
< by
< the
< slight
< modifications
< which
< occur
< ceaselessly
< in
< the
< retinal
< circulation
< or
< by
< the
< pressure
< that
< the
< closed
< lid
< exerts
< upon
< the
< eyeball
< causing
< a
< mechanical
< excitation
< of
< the
< optic
< nerve
< but
< the
< explanation
< of
< the
< phenomenon
< and
< the
< name
< that
< is
< given
< to
< it
< matters
< little
< it
< occurs
< universally
< and
< it
< constitutes--i
< may
< say
< at
< once--the
< principal
< material
< of
< which
< we
< shape
< our
< dreams
< such
< stuff
< as
< dreams
< are
< made
< on
< thirty
< or
< forty
< years
< ago
< m
< alfred
< maury
< and
< about
< the
< same
< time
< m
< dhervey
< of
< st
< denis
< had
< observed
< that
< at
< the
< moment
< of
< falling
< asleep
< these
< colored
< spots
< and
< moving
< forms
< consolidate
< fix
< themselves
< take
< on
< definite
< outlines
< the
< outlines
< of
< the
< objects
< and
< of
< the
< persons
< which
< people
< our
< dreams
< but
< this
< is
< an
< observation
< to
< be
< accepted
< with
< caution
< since
< it
< emanates
< from
< psychologists
< already
< half
< asleep
< more
< recently
< an
< american
< psychologist
< professor
< ladd
< of
< yale
< has
< devised
< a
< more
< rigorous
< method
< but
< of
< difficult
< application
< because
< it
< requires
< a
< sort
< of
< training
< it
< consists
< in
< acquiring
< the
< habit
< on
< awakening
< in
< the
< morning
< of
< keeping
< the
< eyes
< closed
< and
< retaining
< for
< some
< minutes
< the
< dream
< that
< is
< fading
< from
< the
< field
< of
< vision
< and
< soon
< would
< doubtless
< have
< faded
< from
< that
< of
< memory
< then
< one
< sees
< the
< figures
< and
< objects
< of
< the
< dream
< melt
< away
< little
< by
< little
< into
< phosphenes
< identifying
< themselves
< with
< the
< colored
< spots
< that
< the
< eye
< really
< perceives
< when
< the
< lids
< are
< closed
< one
< reads
< for
< example
< a
< newspaper
< that
< is
< the
< dream
< one
< awakens
< and
< there
< remains
< of
< the
< newspaper
< whose
< definite
< outlines
< are
< erased
< only
< a
< white
< spot
< with
< black
< marks
< here
< and
< there
< that
< is
< the
< reality
< or
< our
< dream
< takes
< us
< upon
< the
< open
< sea--round
< about
< us
< the
< ocean
< spreads
< its
< waves
< of
< yellowish
< gray
< with
< here
< and
< there
< a
< crown
< of
< white
< foam
< on
< awakening
< it
< is
< all
< lost
< in
< a
< great
< spot
< half
< yellow
< and
< half
< gray
< sown
< with
< brilliant
< points
< the
< spot
< was
< there
< the
< brilliant
< points
< were
< there
< there
< was
< really
< presented
< to
< our
< perceptions
< in
< sleep
< a
< visual
< dust
< and
< it
< was
< this
< dust
< which
< served
< for
< the
< fabrication
< of
< our
< dreams
< will
< this
< alone
< suffice
< still
< considering
< the
< sensation
< of
< sight
< we
< ought
< to
< add
< to
< these
< visual
< sensations
< which
< we
< may
< call
< internal
< all
< those
< which
< continue
< to
< come
< to
< us
< from
< an

< source
< the

< and

< to

< from

< these

< at

< of
< many
< of
< our
< dreams
< a
< candle
< abruptly
< lighted

< will
< for

< if

< deep

< dominated

< two

< runs
< along

< which
< the

< those
< which
< are
< suggested
< by
< a
< mild
< and
< continuous
< light
< like
< that
< of

< a

< tells

< one
< day
< on

< he

< to
< be

< melted

< of

< which
< darted

< upon

< it
< is
< a
< curious
< thing
< that
< one
< might
< cite

< examples
< of
< dreams
< where
< the
< rays
< of
< the
< moon
< caressing
< the
< eyes
< of
< the
< sleeper
< evoked
< before
< him
< virginal
< apparitions
< may
< we
< not
< suppose
< that
< such
< might
< have
< been
< the
< origin
< in
< antiquity
< of
< the
< fable
< of
< endymion--endymion
< the

< lapped
< in

< slumber
< for
< whom
< the
< goddess

< that
< is

< while

< i
< have
< spoken
< of
< visual
< sensations
< they
< are
< the
< principal
< ones
< but
< the
< auditory
< sensations
< nevertheless
< play
< a
< rle
< first
< the
< ear
< has
< also
< its
< internal
< sensations
< sensations
< of
< buzzing
< of
< tinkling
< of
< whistling
< difficult
< to
< isolate
< and
< to
< perceive
< while
< awake
< but
< which
< are
< clearly
< distinguished
< in
< sleep
< besides
< that
< we
< continue
< when
< once
< asleep
< to
< hear
< external
< sounds
< the
< creaking
< of

< the
< crackling
< of
< the
< fire
< the

< beating
< against

< the

< such
< are
< the
< sounds
< which
< come
< to
< the
< ear
< of
< the

< and
< which
< the

< converts
< according

< into

< of

< such
< observations
< and
< experiences
< are
< numerous
< but
< let
< us
< hasten
< to
< say
< that
< sounds
< do
< not
< play
< in
< our
< dreams
< so
< important
< a
< rle
< as
< colors
< our
< dreams
< are
< above
< all
< visual
< and
< even
< more
< visual
< than
< we
< think
< to
< whom
< has
< it
< not
< happened--as
< m
< max
< simon
< has
< remarked--to
< talk
< in
< a
< dream
< with
< a
< certain
< person
< to
< dream
< a
< whole
< conversation
< and
< then
< all
< of
< a
< sudden
< a
< singular
< phenomenon
< strikes
< the
< attention
< of
< the
< dreamer
< he
< perceives
< that
< he
< does
< not
< speak
< that
< he
< has
< not
< spoken
< that
< his
< interlocutor
< has
< not
< uttered
< a
< single
< word
< that
< it
< was
< a
< simple
< exchange
< of
< thought
< between
< them
< a
< very
< clear
< conversation
< in
< which
< nevertheless
< nothing
< has
< been
< heard
< the
< phenomenon
< is
< easily
< enough
< explained
< it
< is
< in
< general
< necessary
< for
< us
< to
< hear
< sounds
< in
< a
< dream
< from
< nothing
< we
< can
< make
< nothing
< and
< when
< we
< are
< not
< provided
< with
< sonorous
< material
< a
< dream
< would
< find
< it
< hard
< to
< manufacture
< sonority
< there
< is
< much
< more
< to
< say
< about
< the
< sensations
< of
< touch
< than
< about
< those
< of
< hearing
< but
< i
< must
< hasten
< we
< could
< talk
< for
< hours
< about
< the
< singular
< phenomena
< which
< result
< from
< the
< confused
< sensations
< of
< touch
< during
< sleep
< these
< sensations
< mingling
< with
< the
< images
< which
< occupy
< our
< visual
< field
< modify
< them
< or
< arrange
< them
< in
< their
< own
< way
< often
< in
< the
< midst
< of
< the
< night
< the
< contact
< of
< our
< body
< with
< its
< light
< clothing
< makes
< itself
< felt
< all
< at
< once
< and
< reminds
< us
< that
< we
< are
< lightly
< clothed
< then
< if
< our
< dream
< is
< at
< the
< moment
< taking
< us
< through
< the
< street
< it
< is
< in
< this
< simple
< attire
< that
< we
< present
< ourselves
< to
< the
< gaze
< of
< the
< passers-by
< without
< their
< appearing
< to
< be
< astonished
< by
< it
< we
< are
< ourselves
< astonished
< in
< the
< dream
< but
< that
< never
< appears
< to
< astonish
< other
< people
< i
< cite
< this
< dream
< because
< it
< is
< frequent
< there
< is
< another
< which
< many
< of
< us
< must
< have
< experienced
< it
< consists
< of
< feeling
< oneself
< flying
< through
< the
< air
< or
< floating
< in
< space
< once
< having
< had
< this
< dream
< one
< may
< be
< quite
< sure
< that
< it
< will
< reappear
< and
< every
< time
< that
< it
< recurs
< the
< dreamer
< reasons
< in
< this
< way
< i
< have
< had
< before
< now
< in
< a
< dream
< the
< illusion
< of
< flying
< or
< floating
< but
< this
< time
< it
< is
< the
< real
< thing
< it
< has
< certainly
< proved
< to
< me
< that
< we
< may
< free
< ourselves
< from
< the
< law
< of
< gravitation
< now
< if
< you
< wake
< abruptly
< from
< this
< dream
< you
< can
< analyze
< it
< without
< difficulty
< if
< you
< undertake
< it
< immediately
< you
< will
< see
< that
< you
< feel
< very
< clearly
< that
< your
< feet
< are
< not
< touching
< the
< earth
< and
< nevertheless
< not
< believing
< yourself
< asleep
< you
< have
< lost
< sight
< of
< the
< fact
< that
< you
< are
< lying
< down
< therefore
< since
< you
< are
< not
< lying
< down
< and
< yet
< your
< feet
< do
< not
< feel
< the
< resistance
< of
< the
< ground
< the
< conclusion
< is
< natural
< that
< you
< are
< floating
< in
< space
< notice
< this
< also
< when
< levitation
< accompanies
< the
< flight
< it
< is
< on
< one
< side
< only
< that
< you
< make
< an
< effort
< to
< fly
< and
< if
< you
< woke
< at
< that
< moment
< you
< would
< find
< that
< this
< side
< is
< the
< one
< on
< which
< you
< are
< lying
< and
< that
< the
< sensation
< of
< effort
< for
< flight
< coincides
< with
< the
< real
< sensation
< given
< you
< by
< the
< pressure
< of
< your
< body
< against
< the
< bed
< this
< sensation
< of
< pressure
< dissociated
< from
< its
< cause
< becomes
< a
< pure
< and
< simple
< sensation
< of
< effort
< and
< joined
< to
< the
< illusion
< of
< floating
< in
< space
< is
< sufficient
< to
< produce
< the
< dream
< it
< is
< interesting
< to
< see
< that
< these
< sensations
< of
< pressure
< mounting
< so
< to
< speak
< to
< the
< level
< of
< our
< visual
< field
< and
< taking
< advantage
< of
< the
< luminous
< dust
< which
< fills
< it
< effect
< its
< transformation
< into
< forms
< and
< colors
< m
< max
< simon
< tells
< of
< having
< a
< strange
< and
< somewhat
< painful
< dream
< he
< dreamt
< that
< he
< was
< confronted
< by
< two
< piles
< of
< golden
< coins
< side
< by
< side
< and
< of

< for

< during

< but
< we

< distracted
< by

< action
< we
< live

< but
< sleep
< makes

< retire

< it

< dream

< etc
< which
< have
< been
< foreseen
< and
< as
< it
< were
< prophesied
< in
< dreams
< we
< need
< not
< be
< astonished
< then
< that
< philosophers
< like
< schopenhauer
< have
< seen
< in
< the
< dream
< a
< reverberation
< in
< the
< heart
< of
< consciousness
< of
< perturbations
< emanating
< from
< the
< sympathetic

< system
< and
< that
< psychologists
< like

< have
< attributed
< to
< each
< of
< our
< organs
< the
< power
< of
< provoking
< a
< well-determined
< kind
< of
< dream
< which
< represents
< it
< as
< it
< were
< symbolically
< and
< finally
< that
< physicians
< like
< artigues
< have
< written
< treatises
< on
< the
< semeiological
< value
< of
< dreams
< that
< is
< to
< say
< the
< method
< of

< for
< the

< more
< recently
< m

< of
< whom

< have

< has

< are

< of
< the
< digestive
< respiratory
< and
< circulatory
< apparatus
< i
< will
< summarize
< what
< i
< have
< just
< been
< saying
< when
< we
< are
< sleeping
< naturally
< it
< is
< not
< necessary
< to
< believe
< as
< has
< often
< been
< supposed
< that
< our
< senses
< are
< closed
< to
< external
< sensations
< our
< senses
< continue
< to
< be
< active
< they
< act
< it
< is
< true
< with
< less
< precision
< but
< in
< compensation
< they
< embrace
< a
< host
< of
< subjective
< impressions
< which
< pass
< unperceived
< when
< we
< are
< awake--for
< then
< we
< live
< in
< a
< world
< of
< perceptions
< common
< to
< all
< men--and
< which
< reappear
< in
< sleep
< when
< we
< live
< only
< for
< ourselves
< thus
< our
< faculty
< of
< sense
< perception
< far
< from
< being
< narrowed
< during
< sleep
< at
< all
< points
< is
< on
< the
< contrary
< extended
< at
< least
< in
< certain
< directions
< in
< its
< field
< of
< operations
< it
< is
< true
< that
< it
< often
< loses
< in
< energy
< in
< tension
< what
< it
< gains
< in
< extension
< it
< brings
< to
< us
< only
< confused
< impressions
< these
< impressions
< are
< the
< materials
< of
< our
< dreams
< but
< they
< are
< only
< the
< materials
< they
< do
< not
< suffice
< to
< produce
< them
< they
< do
< not
< suffice
< to
< produce
< them
< because
< they
< are
< vague
< and
< indeterminate
< to
< speak
< only
< of
< those
< that
< play
< the

< rle
< the
< changing
< colors
< and
< forms
< which
< deploy
< before

< when

< closed
< never
< have
< well-defined
< contours
< here
< are
< black
< lines
< upon
< a

< background
< they
< may
< represent
< to
< the
< dreamer
< the

< of

< or
< the
< facade
< of
< a
< new
< house
< with
< dark

< or
< any

< of

< things
< who
< will

< that
< will
< imprint
< its
< decision
< upon
< the
< indecision
< of
< this
< material
< this
< form
< is
< our
< memory
< let
< us
< note
< first
< that
< the
< dream
< in
< general
< creates
< nothing
< doubtless
< there
< may
< be
< cited
< some
< examples
< of
< artistic
< literary
< and
< scientific
< production
< in
< dreams
< i
< will
< recall
< only
< the
< well-known
< anecdote
< told
< of
< tartini
< a
< violinist-composer
< of
< the
< eighteenth
< century
< as
< he
< was
< trying
< to
< compose
< a
< sonata
< and
< the
< muse
< remained
< recalcitrant
< he
< went
< to
< sleep
< and
< he
< saw
< in
< a
< dream
< the
< devil
< who
< seized
< his
< violin
< and
< played
< with
< master
< hand
< the
< desired
< sonata
< tartini
< wrote
< it
< out
< from
< memory
< when
< he
< woke
< it
< has
< come
< to
< us
< under
< the
< name
< of
< the
< devils
< sonata
< but
< it
< is
< very
< difficult
< in
< regard
< to
< such
< old
< cases
< to
< distinguish
< between
< history
< and
< legend
< we
< should
< have
< auto-observations
< of
< certain
< authenticity
< now
< i
< have
< not
< been
< able
< to
< find
< anything
< more
< than
< that
< of
< the
< contemporary
< english
< novelist
< stevenson
< in
< a
< very
< curious
< essay
< entitled
< a
< chapter
< on
< dreams
< this
< author
< who
< is
< endowed
< with
< a
< rare
< talent
< for
< analysis
< explains
< to
< us
< how
< the
< most
< original
< of
< his
< stories
< have
< been
< composed
< or
< at
< least
< sketched
< in
< dreams
< but
< read
< the
< chapter
< carefully
< you
< will
< see
< that
< at
< a
< certain
< time
< in
< his
< life
< stevenson
< had
< come
< to
< be
< in
< an
< habitual
< psychical
< state
< where
< it
< was
< very
< hard
< for
< him
< to
< say
< whether
< he
< was
< sleeping
< or
< waking
< that
< appears
< to
< me
< to
< be
< the
< truth
< when
< the
< mind
< creates
< i
< would
< say
< when
< it
< is
< capable
< of
< giving
< the
< effort
< of
< organization
< and
< synthesis
< which
< is
< necessary
< to
< triumph
< over
< a
< certain
< difficulty
< to
< solve
< a
< problem
< to
< produce
< a
< living
< work
< of
< the
< imagination
< we
< are
< not
< really
< asleep
< or
< at
< least
< that
< part
< of
< ourselves
< which
< labors
< is
< not
< the
< same
< as
< that
< which
< sleeps
< we
< cannot
< say
< then
< that
< it
< is
< a
< dream
< in
< sleep
< properly
< speaking
< in
< sleep
< which
< absorbs
< our
< whole
< personality
< it
< is
< memories
< and
< only
< memories
< which
< weave
< the
< web
< of
< our
< dreams
< but
< often
< we
< do
< not
< recognize
< them
< they
< may
< be
< very
< old
< memories
< forgotten
< during
< waking
< hours
< drawn
< from
< the
< most
< obscure
< depths
< of
< our
< past
< they
< may
< be
< often
< are
< memories
< of
< objects
< that
< we
< have
< perceived
< distractedly
< almost
< unconsciously
< while
< awake
< or
< they
< may
< be
< fragments
< of
< broken
< memories
< which
< have
< been
< picked
< up
< here
< and
< there
< and
< mingled
< by
< chance
< composing
< an
< incoherent
< and
< unrecognizable
< whole
< before
< these
< bizarre
< assemblages
< of
< images
< which
< present
< no
< plausible
< significance
< our
< intelligence
< which
< is
< far
< from
< surrendering
< the
< reasoning
< faculty
< during
< sleep
< as
< has
< been
< asserted
< seeks
< an
< explanation
< tries
< to
< fill
< the
< lacun
< it
< fills
< them
< by
< calling
< up
< other
< memories
< which
< presenting
< themselves
< often
< with
< the
< same
< deformations
< and
< the
< same
< incoherences
< as
< the
< preceding
< demand
< in
< their
< turn
< a
< new
< explanation
< and
< so
< on
< indefinitely
< but
< i
< do
< not
< insist
< upon
< this
< point
< for
< the
< moment
< it
< is
< sufficient
< for
< me
< to
< say
< in
< order
< to
< answer
< the
< question
< which
< i
< have
< propounded
< that
< the
< formative
< power
< of
< the
< materials
< furnished
< to
< the
< dream
< by
< the
< different
< senses
< the
< power
< which
< converts
< into
< precise
< determined
< objects
< the
< vague
< and
< indistinct
< sensations
< that
< the
< dreamer
< receives
< from
< his
< eyes
< his

< and
< the
< whole
< surface
< and
< interior
< of
< his
< body
< is
< the
< memory
< memory
< in
< a
< waking
< state
< we
< have
< indeed
< memories
< which
< appear
< and
< disappear
< occupying
< our
< mind
< in
< turn
< but
< they
< are
< always
< memories
< which
< are
< closely
< connected
< with
< our
< present
< situation
< our
< present
< occupation
< our
< present
< action
< i
< recall
< at

< the

< on

< that

< memory
< is

< less
< the
< slave

< but
< still
< it
< sticks
< to
< it
< our

< at

< a
< solid
< whole
< a
< pyramid
< so
< to
< speak
< whose

< into

< but
< behind
< the
< memories
< which
< are
< concerned

< and
< are

< by

< it
< there

< the

< indeed
< that
< all
< our

< is
< there
< preserved

< we
< have
< felt

< in

< are
< there
< in

< to

< they
< do
< not
< even
< try
< to
< rise
< to
< it
< they
< know
< that
< it

< and
< that
< i
< as
< a
< living
< and

< being
< have
< something

< to

< when

< suppose
< that
< all

< in

< case
< the
< whole
< day
< would
< hardly
< be
< long
< enough
< for
< you
< to
< read
< a

< the
< truth
< is
< that
< you
< see
< in
< each
< word
< and
< even
< in
< each
< member
< of
< a
< phrase
< only
< some
< letters
< or
< even
< some
< characteristic
< marks
< just
< enough
< to
< permit
< you
< to
< divine
< the
< rest
< all
< of
< the
< rest
< that
< you
< think
< you
< see
< you
< really
< give
< yourself
< as
< an
< hallucination
< there
< are
< numerous
< and
< decisive
< experiments
< which
< leave
< no
< doubt
< on
< this
< point
< i
< will
< cite
< only
< those
< of
< goldscheider
< and
< mller
< these
< experimenters
< wrote
< or
< printed
< some
< formulas
< in
< common
< use
< positively
< no
< admission
< preface
< to
< the
< fourth
< edition
< etc
< but
< they
< took
< care
< to
< write
< the
< words
< incorrectly
< changing
< and
< above
< all
< omitting
< letters
< these
< sentences
< were
< exposed
< in
< a
< darkened
< room
< the
< person
< who
< served
< as
< the
< subject
< of
< the
< experiment
< was
< placed
< before
< them
< and
< did
< not
< know
< of
< course
< what
< had
< been
< written
< then
< the
< inscription
< was
< illuminated
< by
< the
< electric
< light
< for
< a
< very
< short
< time
< too
< short
< for
< the
< observer
< to
< be
< able
< to
< perceive
< really
< all
< the
< letters
< they
< began
< by
< determining
< experimentally
< the
< time
< necessary
< for
< seeing
< one
< letter
< of
< the
< alphabet
< it
< was
< then
< easy
< to
< arrange
< it
< so
< that
< the
< observer
< could
< not
< perceive
< more
< than
< eight
< or
< ten
< letters
< for
< example
< of
< the
< thirty
< or
< forty
< letters
< composing
< the
< formula
< usually
< however
< he
< read
< the
< entire
< phrase
< without
< difficulty
< but
< that
< is
< not
< for
< us
< the
< most
< instructive
< point
< of
< this
< experiment
< if
< the
< observer
< is
< asked
< what
< are
< the
< letters
< that
< he
< is
< sure
< of
< having
< seen
< these
< may
< be
< of
< course
< the
< letters
< really
< written
< but
< there
< may
< be
< also
< absent
< letters
< either
< letters
< that
< we
< replaced
< by
< others
< or
< that
< have
< simply
< been
< omitted
< thus
< an
< observer
< will
< see
< quite
< distinctly
< in
< full
< light
< a
< letter
< which
< does
< not
< exist
< if
< this
< letter
< on
< account
< of
< the
< general
< sense
< ought
< to
< enter
< into
< the
< phrase
< the
< characters
< which
< have
< really
< affected
< the
< eye
< have
< been
< utilized
< only
< to
< serve
< as
< an
< indication
< to
< the
< unconscious
< memory
< of
< the
< observer
< this
< memory
< discovering
< the
< appropriate
< remembrance
< ie
< finding
< the
< formula
< to
< which
< these
< characters
< give
< a
< start
< toward
< realization
< projects
< the
< remembrance
< externally
< in
< an
< hallucinatory
< form
< it
< is
< this
< remembrance
< and
< not
< the
< words
< themselves
< that
< the
< observer
< has
< seen
< it
< is
< thus
< demonstrated
< that
< rapid
< reading
< is
< in
< great
< part
< a
< work
< of
< divination
< but
< not
< of
< abstract
< divination
< it
< is
< an
< externalization
< of
< memories
< which
< take
< advantage
< to
< a
< certain
< extent
< of
< the
< partial
< realization
< that
< they
< find
< here
< and
< there
< in
< order
< to
< completely
< realize
< themselves
< thus
< in
< the
< waking
< state
< and
< in
< the
< knowledge
< that
< we
< get
< of
< the
< real
< objects
< which
< surround
< us
< an
< operation
< is
< continually
< going
< on
< which
< is
< of
< quite
< the
< same
< nature
< as
< that
< of
< the
< dream
< we
< perceive
< merely
< a
< sketch
< of
< the
< object
< this
< sketch
< appeals
< to
< the
< complete
< memory
< and
< this
< complete
< memory
< which
< by
< itself
< was
< either
< unconscious
< or
< simply
< in
< the
< thought
< state
< profits
< by
< the
< occasion
< to
< come
< out
< it
< is
< this
< kind
< of
< hallucination
< inserted
< and
< fitted
< into
< a
< real
< frame
< that
< we
< perceive
< it
< is
< a
< shorter
< process
< it
< is
< very
< much
< quicker
< done
< than
< to
< see
< the
< thing
< itself
< besides
< there
< are
< many
< interesting
< observations
< to
< be
< made
< upon
< the
< conduct
< and
< attitude
< of
< the
< memory
< images
< during
< this
< operation
< it
< is
< not
< necessary
< to
< suppose
< that
< they
< are
< in
< our
< memory
< in
< a
< state
< of
< inert
< impressions
< they
< are
< like
< the
< steam
< in
< a
< boiler
< under
< more
< or
< less
< tension
< at
< the
< moment
< when
< the
< perceived
< sketch
< calls
< them
< forth
< it
< is
< as
< if
< they
< were
< then
< grouped
< in
< families
< according
< to
< their
< relationship
< and
< resemblances
< there
< are
< experiments
< of
< mnsterberg
< earlier
< than
< those
< of
< goldscheider
< and
< mller
< which
< appear
< to
< me
< to
< confirm
< this
< hypothesis
< although
< they
< were
< made
< for
< a
< very
< different
< purpose
< mnsterberg
< wrote
< the
< words
< correctly
< they
< were
< besides
< not
< common
< phrases
< they
< were
< isolated
< words
< taken
< by
< chance
< here
< again
< the
< word
< was
< exposed
< during
< the
< time
< too
< short
< for
< it
< to
< be
< entirely
< perceived
< now
< while
< the
< observer
< was
< looking
< at
< the
< written
< word
< some
< one
< spoke
< in
< his
< ear
< another
< word
< of
< a
< very
< different
< significance
< this
< is
< what
< happened
< the
< observer
< declared
< that
< he
< had
< seen
< a
< word
< which
< was
< not
< the
< written
< word
< but
< which
< resembled
< it
< in
< its
< general
< form
< and
< which
< besides
< recalled
< by
< its
< meaning
< the
< word
< which
< was
< spoken
< in
< his
< ear
< for
< example
< the
< word
< written
< was
< tumult
< and
< the
< word
< spoken
< was
< railroad
< the
< observer
< read
< tunnel
< the
< written
< word
< was
< trieste
< and
< the
< spoken
< word
< was
< the
< german
< verzweiflung
< despair
< the
< observer
< read
< trost
< which
< signifies
< consolation
< it
< is
< as
< if
< the
< word
< railroad
< pronounced
< in
< the
< ear
< wakened
< without
< our
< knowing
< it
< hopes
< of
< conscious
< realization
< in
< a
< crowd
< of
< memories
< which
< have
< some
< relationship
< with
< the
< idea
< of
< railroad
< car
< rail
< trip
< etc
< but
< this
< is
< only
< a
< hope
< and
< the
< memory
< which
< succeeds
< in
< coming
< into
< consciousness
< is
< that
< which
< the
< actually
< present
< sensation
< had
< already
< begun
< to
< realize
< such
< is
< the
< mechanism
< of
< true
< perception
< and
< such
< is
< that
< of
< the
< dream
< in
< both
< cases
< there
< are
< on
< one
< hand
< real
< impressions
< made
< upon
< the
< organs
< of
< sense
< and
< upon
< the
< other
< memories
< which
< encase
< themselves
< in
< the
< impression
< and
< profit
< by
< its
< vitality
< to
< return
< again
< to
< life
< but
< then
< what
< is
< the
< essential
< difference
< between
< perceiving
< and
< dreaming
< what
< is
< sleep
< i
< do
< not
< ask
< of
< course
< how
< sleep
< can
< be
< explained
< physiologically
< that
< is
< a
< special
< question
< and
< besides
< is
< far
< from
< being
< settled
< i
< ask
< what
< is
< sleep
< psychologically
< for
< our
< mind
< continues
< to
< exercise
< itself
< when
< we
< are
< asleep
< and
< it
< exercises
< itself
< as
< we
< have
< just
< seen
< on
< elements
< analogous
< to
< those
< of
< waking
< on
< sensations
< and
< memories
< and
< also
< in
< an
< analogous
< manner
< combines
< them
< nevertheless
< we
< have
< on
< the
< one
< hand
< normal
< perception
< and
< on
< the
< other
< the
< dream
< what
< is
< the
< difference
< i
< repeat
< what
< are
< the
< psychological
< characteristics
< of
< the
< sleeping
< state
< we
< must
< distrust
< theories
< there
< are
< a
< great
< many
< of
< them
< on
< this
< point
< some
< say
< that
< sleep
< consists
< in
< isolating
< oneself
< from
< the
< external
< world
< in
< closing
< the
< senses
< to
< outside
< things
< but
< we
< have
< shown
< that
< our
< senses
< continue
< to
< act
< during
< sleep
< that
< they
< provide
< us
< with
< the
< outline
< or
< at
< least
< the
< point
< of
< departure
< of
< most
< of
< our
< dreams
< some
< say
< to
< go
< to
< sleep
< is
< to
< stop
< the
< action
< of
< the
< superior
< faculties
< of
< the
< mind
< and
< they
< talk
< of
< a
< kind
< of
< momentary
< paralysis
< of
< the
< higher
< centers
< i
< do
< not
< think
< that
< this
< is
< much
< more
< exact
< in
< a
< dream
< we
< become
< no
< doubt
< indifferent
< to
< logic
< but
< not
< incapable
< of
< logic
< there
< are
< dreams
< when
< we
< reason
< with
< correctness
< and
< even
< with
< subtlety
< i
< might
< almost
< say
< at
< the
< risk
< of
< seeming
< paradoxical
< that
< the
< mistake
< of
< the
< dreamer
< is
< often
< in
< reasoning
< too
< much
< he
< would
< avoid
< the
< absurdity
< if
< he
< would
< remain
< a
< simple
< spectator
< of
< the
< procession
< of
< images
< which
< compose
< his
< dream
< but
< when
< he
< strongly
< desires
< to
< explain
< it
< his
< explanation
< intended
< to
< bind
< together
< incoherent
< images
< can
< be
< nothing
< more
< than
< a
< bizarre
< reasoning
< which
< verges
< upon
< absurdity
< i
< recognize
< indeed
< that
< our
< superior
< intellectual
< faculties
< are
< relaxed
< in
< sleep
< that
< generally
< the
< logic
< of
< a
< dreamer
< is
< feeble
< enough
< and
< often
< resembles
< a
< mere
< parody
< of
< logic
< but
< one
< might
< say
< as
< much
< of
< all
< of
< our
< faculties
< during
< sleep
< it
< is
< then
< not
< by
< the
< abolition
< of
< reasoning
< any
< more
< than
< by
< the
< closing
< of
< the
< senses
< that
< we
< characterize
< dreaming
< something
< else
< is
< essential
< we
< need
< something
< more
< than
< theories
< we
< need
< an
< intimate
< contact
< with
< the
< facts
< one
< must
< make
< the
< decisive
< experiment
< upon
< oneself
< it
< is
< necessary
< that
< on
< coming
< out
< of
< a
< dream
< since
< we
< cannot
< analyze
< ourselves
< in
< the
< dream
< itself
< we
< should
< watch
< the
< transition
< from
< sleeping
< to
< waking
< follow
< upon
< the
< transition
< as
< closely
< as
< possible
< and
< try
< to
< express
< by
< words
< what
< we
< experience
< in
< this
< passage
< this
< is
< very
< difficult
< but
< may
< be
< accomplished
< by
< forcing
< the
< attention
< permit
< then
< the
< writer
< to
< take
< an
< example
< from
< his
< own
< personal
< experience
< and
< to
< tell
< of
< a
< recent
< dream
< as
< well
< as
< what
< was
< accomplished
< on
< coming
< out
< of
< the

< now
< the

< before

< assembly
< then
< in

< of
< the

< a
< murmur
< rose
< the
< murmur
< augmented
< it
< became
< a
< muttering
< then
< it
< became
< a
< roar
< a
< frightful
< tumult
< and
< finally
< there
< resounded
< from
< all
< parts
< timed
< to
< a
< uniform
< rhythm
< the
< cries
< out
< out
< at

< moment
< he

< of

< of

< here
< was
< the

< moment
< which
< it
< is

< seize
< the
< waking
< ego
< just
< reappearing
< should
< turn
< to
< the

< ego
< which

< and
< during

< without

< at

< now
< i

< until
< you
< tell

< what
< you
< were
< doing
< to
< which
< the

< would

< where

< and
< to
< know
< that

< is

< you
< have

< that
< is
< a

< mistake
< you
< accomplish
< without

< it
< a
< considerable
< effort
< you
< take

< all

< of
< memories
< to
< converge
< upon
< a

< point
< in
< such

< sounds
< you

< of

< memories
< which
< is
< the
< most
< capable

< you
< can
< only
< obtain
< by
< an
< effort
< of

< and
< an
< effort
< of
< the
< perception
< just
< as

< an
< enormous
< effort
< your
< life
< in

< when

< you
< have
< to
< choose
< and
< every

< choose
< among
< your
< sensations
< since

< reject
< from
< your
< consciousness
< a
< thousand
< subjective
< sensations
< which
< come
< back
< in
< the
< night
< when
< you
< sleep
< you
< choose
< and
< with
< extreme
< precision
< and
< delicacy
< among
< your
< memories
< since
< you
< reject
< all
< that
< do
< not
< exactly
< suit
< your
< present
< state
< this
< choice
< which
< you
< continually
< accomplish

< adaptation
< ceaselessly
< renewed
< is
< the
< first
< and
< most
< essential
< condition
< of
< what
< is
< called
< common

< but

< this
< keeps
< you
< in

< uninterrupted
< tension
< you
< do
< not
< feel

< at

< moment
< any

< upon

< point
< when

< have
< ceased

< what
< needs

< more
< to
< be
< explained
< is
< the

< mechanism
< by
< which
< at

< your

< obtains

< and

< the

< and

< point
< the

< but
< to

< this
< is
< the
< task
< of

< of
< the
< psychology
< of
< waking
< for
< willing
< and
< waking
< are
< one
< and
< the
< same
< thing
< this
< is
< what
< the
< dreaming
< ego
< would
< say
< and
< it
< would
< tell
< us
< a
< great
< many
< other
< things
< still
< if
< we
< could
< let
< it
< talk
< freely
< but
< let
< us
< sum
< up
< briefly
< the
< essential
< difference
< which
< separates
< a
< dream
< from
< the
< waking
< state
< in
< the
< dream
< the
< same
< faculties
< are
< exercised
< as
< during
< waking
< but
< they
< are
< in
< a
< state
< of
< tension
< in
< the
< one
< case
< and
< of
< relaxation
< in
< the
< other
< the
< dream
< consists
< of
< the
< entire
< mental
< life
< minus
< the
< tension
< the
< effort
< and
< the
< bodily
< movement
< we
< perceive
< still
< we
< remember
< still
< we
< reason
< still
< all
< this
< can
< abound
< in
< the
< dream
< for
< abundance
< in
< the
< domain
< of
< the
< mind
< does
< not
< mean
< effort
< what
< requires
< an
< effort
< is
< the
< precision
< of
< adjustment
< to
< connect
< the
< sound
< of
< a
< barking
< dog
< with
< the
< memory
< of
< a
< crowd
< that
< murmurs
< and
< shouts
< requires
< no
< effort
< but
< in
< order
< that
< this
< sound
< should
< be
< perceived
< as
< the
< barking
< of
< a
< dog
< a
< positive
< effort
< must
< be
< made
< it
< is
< this
< force
< that
< the
< dreamer
< lacks
< it
< is
< by
< that
< and
< by
< that
< alone
< that
< he
< is
< distinguished
< from
< the
< waking
< man
< from
< this
< essential
< difference
< can
< be
< drawn
< a
< great
< many
< others
< we
< can
< come
< to
< understand
< the
< chief
< characteristics
< of
< the
< dream
< but
< i
< can
< only
< outline
< the
< scheme
< of
< this
< study
< it
< depends
< especially
< upon
< three
< points
< which
< are
< the
< incoherence
< of
< dreams
< the
< abolition
< of
< the
< sense
< of
< duration
< that
< often
< appears
< to
< be
< manifested
< in
< dreams
< and
< finally
< the
< order
< in
< which
< the
< memories
< present
< themselves
< to
< the
< dreamer
< contending
< for
< the
< sensations
< present
< where
< they
< are
< to
< be
< embodied
< the
< incoherence
< of
< the
< dream
< seems
< to
< me
< easy
< enough
< to
< explain
< as
< it
< is
< characteristic
< of
< the
< dream
< not
< to
< demand
< a
< complete
< adjustment
< between
< the
< memory
< image
< and
< the
< sensation
< but
< on
< the
< contrary
< to
< allow
< some
< play
< between
< them
< very
< different
< memories
< can
< suit
< the
< same
< sensation
< for
< example
< there
< may
< be
< in
< the
< field
< of
< vision
< a
< green
< spot
< with
< white
< points
< this
< might
< be
< a
< lawn
< spangled
< with
< white
< flowers
< it
< might
< be
< a
< billiard-table
< with
< its
< balls
< it
< might
< be
< a
< host
< of
< other
< things
< besides
< these
< different
< memory
< images
< all
< capable
< of
< utilizing
< the
< same
< sensation
< chase
< after
< it
< sometimes
< they
< attain
< it
< one
< after
< the
< other
< and
< so
< the
< lawn
< becomes
< a
< billiard-table
< and
< we
< watch
< these
< extraordinary
< transformations
< often
< it
< is
< at
< the
< same
< time
< and
< altogether
< that
< these
< memory
< images
< join
< the
< sensation
< and
< then
< the
< lawn
< will
< be
< a
< billiard-table
< from
< this
< come
< those
< absurd
< dreams
< where
< an
< object
< remains
< as
< it
< is
< and
< at
< the
< same
< time
< becomes
< something
< else
< as
< i
< have
< just
< said
< the
< mind
< confronted
< by
< these
< absurd
< visions
< seeks
< an
< explanation
< and
< often
< thereby
< aggravates
< the
< incoherence
< as
< for
< the
< abolition
< of
< the
< sense
< of
< time
< in
< many
< of
< our
< dreams
< that
< is
< another
< effect
< of
< the
< same
< cause
< in
< a
< few
< seconds
< a
< dream
< can
< present
< to
< us
< a
< series
< of
< events
< which
< will
< occupy
< in
< the
< waking
< state
< entire
< days
< you
< know
< the
< example
< cited
< by
< m
< maury
< it
< has
< become
< classic
< and
< although
< it
< has
< been
< contested
< of
< late
< i
< regard
< it
< as
< probable
< because
< of
< the
< great
< number
< of
< analogous
< observations
< that
< i
< found
< scattered
< through
< the
< literature
< of
< dreams
< but
< this
< precipitation
< of
< the
< images
< is
< not
< at
< all
< mysterious
< when
< we
< are
< awake
< we
< live
< a
< life
< in
< common
< with
< our
< fellows
< our
< attention
< to
< this
< external
< and
< social
< life
< is
< the
< great
< regulator
< of
< the
< succession
< of
< our
< internal
< states
< it
< is
< like
< the
< balance
< wheel
< of
< a
< watch
< which
< moderates
< and
< cuts
< into
< regular
< sections
< the
< undivided
< almost
< instantaneous
< tension
< of
< the
< spring
< it
< is
< this
< balance
< wheel
< which
< is
< lacking
< in
< the
< dream
< acceleration
< is
< no
< more
< than
< abundance
< a
< sign
< of
< force
< in
< the
< domain
< of
< the
< mind
< it
< is
< i
< repeat
< the
< precision
< of
< adjustment
< that
< requires
< effort
< and
< this
< is
< exactly
< what
< the
< dreamer
< lacks
< he
< is
< no
< longer
< capable
< of
< that
< attention
< to
< life
< which
< is
< necessary
< in
< order
< that
< the
< inner
< may
< be
< regulated
< by
< the
< outer
< and
< that
< the
< internal
< duration
< fit
< exactly
< into
< the
< general
< duration
< of
< things
< it
< remains
< now
< to
< explain
< how
< the
< peculiar
< relaxation
< of
< the
< mind
< in
< the
< dream
< accounts
< for
< the
< preference
< given
< by
< the
< dreamer
< to
< one
< memory
< image
< rather
< than
< others
< equally
< capable
< of
< being
< inserted
< into
< the
< actual
< sensations
< there
< is
< a
< current
< prejudice
< to
< the
< effect
< that
< we
< dream
< mostly
< about
< the
< events
< which
< have
< especially
< preoccupied
< us
< during
< the
< day
< this
< is
< sometimes
< true
< but
< when
< the
< psychological
< life
< of
< the
< waking
< state
< thus
< prolongs
< itself
< into
< sleep
< it
< is
< because
< we
< hardly
< sleep
< a
< sleep
< filled
< with
< dreams
< of
< this
< kind
< would
< be
< a
< sleep
< from
< which
< we
< come
< out
< quite
< fatigued
< in
< normal
< sleep
< our
< dreams
< concern
< themselves
< rather
< other
< things
< being
< equal
< with
< the
< thoughts
< which
< we
< have
< passed
< through
< rapidly
< or
< upon
< objects
< which
< we
< have
< perceived
< almost
< without
< paying
< attention
< to
< them
< if
< we
< dream
< about
< events
< of
< the
< same
< day
< it
< is
< the
< most
< insignificant
< facts
< and
< not
< the
< most
< important
< which
< have
< the
< best
< chance
< of
< reappearing
< i
< agree
< entirely
< on
< this
< point
< with
< the
< observation
< of
< w
< robert
< of
< delage
< and
< of
< freud
< i
< was
< in
< the
< street
< i
< was
< waiting
< for
< a
< street-car
< i
< stood
< beside
< the
< track
< and
< did
< not
< run
< the
< least
< risk
< but
< if
< at
< the
< moment
< when
< the
< street-car
< passed
< the
< idea
< of
< possible
< danger
< had
< crossed
< my
< mind
< or
< even
< if
< my
< body
< had
< instinctively
< recoiled
< without
< my
< having
< been
< conscious
< of
< feeling
< any
< fear
< i
< might
< dream
< that
< night
< that
< the
< car
< had
< run
< over
< my
< body
< i
< watch
< at
< the
< bedside
< of
< an
< invalid
< whose
< condition
< is
< hopeless
< if
< at
< any
< moment
< perhaps
< without
< even
< being
< aware
< of
< it
< i
< had
< hoped
< against
< hope
< i
< might
< dream
< that
< the
< invalid
< was
< cured
< i
< should
< dream
< of
< the
< cure
< in
< any
< case
< more
< probably
< than
< that
< i
< should
< dream
< of
< the
< disease
< in
< short
< the
< events
< which
< reappear
< by
< preference
< in
< the
< dream
< are
< those
< of
< which
< we
< have
< thought
< most
< distractedly
< what
< is
< there
< astonishing
< about
< that
< the
< ego
< of
< the
< dream
< is
< an
< ego
< that
< is
< relaxed
< the
< memories
< which
< it
< gathers
< most
< readily
< are
< the
< memories
< of
< relaxation
< and
< distraction
< those
< which
< do
< not
< bear
< the
< mark
< of
< effort
< it
< is
< true
< that
< in
< very
< profound
< slumber
< the
< law
< that
< regulates
< the
< reappearance
< of
< memories
< may
< be
< very
< different
< we
< know
< almost
< nothing
< of
< this
< profound
< slumber
< the
< dreams
< which
< fill
< it
< are
< as
< a
< general
< rule
< the
< dreams
< which
< we
< forget
< sometimes
< nevertheless
< we
< recover
< something
< of
< them
< and
< then
< it
< is
< a
< very
< peculiar
< feeling
< strange
< indescribable
< that
< we
< experience
< it
< seems
< to
< us
< that
< we
< have
< returned
< from
< afar
< in
< space
< and
< afar
< in
< time
< these
< are
< doubtless
< very
< old
< scenes
< scenes
< of
< youth
< or
< infancy
< that
< we
< live
< over
< then
< in
< all
< their
< details
< with
< a
< mood
< which
< colors
< them
< with
< that
< fresh
< sensation
< of
< infancy
< and
< youth
< that
< we
< seek
< vainly
< to
< revive
< when
< awake
< it
< is
< upon
< this
< profound
< slumber
< that
< psychology
< ought
< to
< direct
< its
< efforts
< not
< only
< to
< study
< the
< mechanism
< of
< unconscious
< memory
< but
< to
< examine
< the
< more
< mysterious
< phenomena
< which
< are
< raised
< by
< psychical
< research
< i
< do
< not
< dare
< express
< an
< opinion
< upon
< phenomena
< of
< this
< class
< but
< i
< cannot
< avoid
< attaching
< some
< importance
< to
< the
< observations
< gathered
< by
< so
< rigorous
< a
< method
< and
< with
< such
< indefatigable
< zeal
< by
< the
< society
< for
< psychical
< research
< if
< telepathy
< influences
< our
< dreams
< it
< is
< quite
< likely
< that
< in
< this
< profound
< slumber
< it
< would
< have
< the
< greatest
< chance
< to
< manifest
< itself
< but
< i
< repeat
< i
< cannot
< express
< an
< opinion
< upon
< this
< point
< i
< have
< gone
< forward
< with
< you
< as
< far
< as
< i
< can
< i
< stop
< upon
< the
< threshold
< of
< the
< mystery
< to
< explore
< the
< most
< secret
< depths
< of
< the
< unconscious
< to
< labor
< in
< what
< i
< have
< just
< called
< the
< subsoil
< of
< consciousness
< that
< will
< be
< the
< principal
< task
< of
< psychology
< in
< the
< century
< which
< is
< opening
< i
< do
< not
< doubt
< that
< wonderful
< discoveries
< await
< it
< there
< as
< important
< perhaps
< as
< have
< been
< in
< the
< preceding
< centuries
< the
< discoveries
< of
< the
< physical
< and
< natural
< sciences
< that
< at

< is

< in
